[xmodmap][] has long been the only way to modify the keyboard map of
the X server, short of the complex configuration daemon approaches
used by the large desktop managers, like KDE and GNOME. But it has
always been a hack: it modifies the X keyboard map and thus requires a
baseline to work from, kind of like a patch needs the correct context
to be applicable.

Worse yet, `xmodmap` weirdness required me to [invoke it twice][] to
get the effect I wanted.

When the recent upgrade to [X.org 7.4][] broke larger parts of [my
elaborate xmodmap configuration][], I took the time to finally ditch
`xmodmap` and implement my modifications as proper [xkb][]
configuration.

# Background information

I [had tried before to use per-user xkb configuration][], but could
not find the answers I want. It was somewhat by chance that I found
[Doug Palmer's "Unreliable Guide to XKB configuration"][] at the same
time that Julien Cristau and Matthew W. S. Bell provided me the
necessary hints on the `#xorg/irc.freenode.org` IRC channel to get me
started.

The other resource worth mentioning is [Ivan Pascal's collection of
XKB documents][], which were instrumental in my gaining an
understanding of `xkb`.

And just as I am writing this document, Debian's X Strike Force have
published their [Input Hotplug Guide][], which is a nice complement to
this very document you are reading right now, since it focuses on
auto-configuration of `xkb` with *HAL*. The default `xkb`
configuration comes with a lot of flexibility, and often you don't
need anything else.

But when you do, then this is how to do it:

# Installing a new keyboard map

The most basic way to install a new keyboard map is using `xkbcomp`, which can
also be used to dump the currently installed map into a file. So, to get a bit
of an idea of what we'll be dealing with, please run the following commands:

    ::sh
    xkbcomp $DISPLAY xkb.dump
    editor xkb.dump
    xkbcomp xkb.dump $DISPLAY

The file is complex and large, and it completely went against my aesthetics to
edit it to have `xkb` work according to my needs. I sought a way in
which I could use as much as possible of the default configuration, and only
place self-contained additional snippets in place to do the things I wanted
done differently.

# `setxkbmap` and rule files

Thus began my voyage into the domain of rule files. But before we dive
into those, let's take a look at `setxkbmap`. Despite the trivial
invocation of e.g. `setxkbmap us` to install a standard US-American
keyboard map, the command also takes arguments. More specifically, it
allows you to specify the following high-level parameters, which
determine the sequence of events between key press and an application
receiving a KeyPress event:

- Model: the keyboard model, which defines which keys are where
- Layout: the keyboard layout, which defines what the keys actually are
- Variant: slight variations in the layout
- Options: configurable aspects of keyboard features and possibilities

Thus, with the following command line, I would select a US layout with
international (dead) keys for my ThinkPad keyboard, and switch to an
alternate symbol group with the windows keys (more on that later):

    ::sh
    setxkbmap -model thinkpad -layout us -variant intl -option grp:win_switch

In many cases, between all combinations of the aforementioned parameters, this
is all you ever need.

But I wanted more.

If you append `-print` to the above command, it will print the keymap
it would install, rather than installing it:

    ::console
    $ setxkbmap -model thinkpad -layout us -variant intl -option grp:win_switch -print
    xkb_keymap {
      xkb_keycodes  { include "evdev+aliases(qwerty)"       };
      xkb_types     { include "complete"    };
      xkb_compat    { include "complete"    };
      xkb_symbols   { include "pc+us(intl)+inet(evdev)+group(win_switch)"   };
      xkb_geometry  { include "thinkpad(us)"        };
    };

There are two things to note:

1. The `-option grp:win_switch` argument has been turned into an additional
   include `group(win_switch)` on the `xkb_symbols` line, just like the model,
   layout, and variant are responsible for other aspects in the output.

2. The output seems related to what `xkbcomp` dumped into the `xkb.dump` file
   we created earlier. Upon closer inspection, the dump file
   is a pre-processed version of the keyboard map, with `include`
   instructions exploded.

At this point, it became clear to me that this was the correct way forward,
and I started to investigate those points in order.

The translation from parameters to an `xkb_keymap` stanza by `setxkbmap` is
actually governed by a rule file. A rule is nothing more than a set of
criteria, and what `setxkbmap` should do in case they all match. On a Debian
system, you can find this file in `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev`, and
`/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst` is a listing of all available parameter
values.

The `xkb_symbols` include line in the above `xkb_keymap` output is the result
of the following rules in the first file, which `setxkbmap` had matched (from
top to bottom) and processed:

    ! model         layout              =       symbols
      […]
      *             *                   =       pc+%l(%v)

    ! model                             =       symbols
      *                                 =       +inet(evdev)

    ! option                            =       symbols
      […]
      grp:win_switch                    =       +group(win_switch)

It should now not be hard to deduce the `xkb_symbols` include line quoted
above, starting from the `setxkbmap` command line. I'll reproduce both for you
for convenience:

    setxkbmap -model thinkpad -layout us -variant intl -option grp:win_switch
    xkb_symbols   { include "pc+us(intl)+inet(evdev)+group(win_switch)"   };

A short note about the syntax here: `group(win_switch)` in the symbols column
references the `xkb_symbols` stanza named `win_switch` in the symbols
file `group` (`/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/group`).

Thus, the rules file maps parameters to sets of snippets to include, and the
output of `setxkbmap` applies those rules to create the `xkb_keymap` output,
to be processed by `xkbcomp`—which `setxkbmap` invokes implicitly, unless
the `-print` argument was given on invocation.

It seems that for a criteria (option, model, layout, ...) to be
honoured, it has to appear in the corresponding listing file,
`evdev.lst` in this case. There is also `evdev.xml`, but I couldn't
figure out its role.

# Attaching symbols to keys

I ended up creating [a symbols file of reasonable size][], which I
won't discuss here. Instead, let's solve the following two tasks for
the purpose of this document:

1. Make the Win-Hyphen key combination generate an "en" dash (–), and
   Win-Shift-Hyphen an "em" dash (—).

2. Let the Caps Lock key generate `Mod4`, which can be used e.g. to control
   the window manager.

To approach these two tasks, let's create a symbols file in
`~/.xkb/symbols/xkbtest` and add two stanzas to it:

    partial alphanumeric_keys
    xkb_symbols "dashes" {
      key <AE11> {
        symbols[Group2] = [ endash, emdash ]
      };
    };

    partial modifier_keys
    xkb_symbols "caps_mod4" {
      replace key <CAPS> {
        [ VoidSymbol, VoidSymbol ]
      };
      modifier_map Mod4 { <CAPS> };
    };

Now let me explain these in turn:

1. We used the option `grp:win_switch` earlier, which told `xkb` that we would
   like to use the windows keys to switch to group 2. In the custom symbols
   file, we now define the symbols to be generated for each key, when
   the second group has been selected.

   Key `<AE11>` is the hyphen key. To find out the names of all the other keys
   on your keyboard, you can use the following command:

    ::sh
    xkbprint -label name $DISPLAY - | gv -orientation=seascape -

   I had to declare the stanza `partial` because it is not a complete keyboard
   map, but can only be used to augment/modify other maps. I also declared it
   `alphanumeric_keys` to tell `xkb` that I would be modifying alphanumeric
   keys inside it. If I also wanted to change modifier keys, I would *also*
   specify `modifier_keys`.

   The rest should be straight-forward. You can get the names of available
   symbols from `keysymdef.h`,[^keysymdef] stripping the `XK_` prefix.

2. The second stanza *replaces* the Caps Lock key definition and prevents it
   from generating symbols (`VoidSymbol`).

   The important aspect of the second stanza is the `modifier_map`
   instruction, which causes the key to generate the `Mod4` modifier event,
   which I can later use to bind key combinations for my window manager
   ([awesome][]).

   A note about `VoidSymbol` (as opposed to e.g. `Hyper L` as the symbol to be
   generated by the caps lock key: As far as I understood, Control, Shift, and
   Caps are necessary symbols, but all the others (including Alt and Meta) are
   actually just symbols and independent from any other function of the keys.
   In particular, `modifier_map` seems completely independent of the symbols.
   As many applications use Meta/Alt, you won't get around generating those,
   but I don't know of applications that use Super or Hyper, so I prefer not
   to generate them.

[^keysymdef]: `/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h` on a Debian system,
   package [x11proto-core-dev][].

The easiest way to verify those changes is to put the `setxkbmap -print`
output of the keyboard map you would like to use as a baseline into
`~/.xkb/keymap/xkbtest`, and append snippets to be included to the
`xkb_symbols` line, e.g.:

    "pc+us(intl)+inet(evdev)+group(win_switch)+xkbtest(dashes)+xkbtest(caps_mod4)"

When you try to load this keyboard map with `xkbcomp`, it will fail
because it cannot find the `xkbtest` symbol definition file. You have
to let the tool know where to look, by appending a path to its search
list (note the use of `$HOME` instead of `~`, which [the shell would
not expand][524513]):

    ::sh
    xkbcomp -I$HOME/.xkb ~/.xkb/keymap/xkbtest $DISPLAY

You can use `xev` to verify the results, or just type Win-Hyphen into a
terminal; does it produce "–"?

By the way, I found `xev` much more useful for such purposes when
invoked as follows (thanks to [Penny][] for the idea):

    ::sh
    xev | sed -ne '/^KeyPress/,/^$/p'

`xev` can also tell you which modifiers are in effect. For that, you have to
hold the modifying key down, press another key, and take note of the `state`
field, which is the hexadecimal sum of all modifiers in effect. The ones I
found are:

    0x0001 Shift
    0x0002 Caps
    0x0004 Control
    0x0008 Alt
    0x0010 NumLock
    0x0030 Mod3
    0x0040 Mod4
    0x2000 Mode_switch

Thanks to Marius Gedminas for the hint.

# Rules again, and why I did not use them in the end

Once I got this far, I proceeded to add [option-to-symbol-snippet
mappings to the rules file][], and added [each option to the listing
file][] too. A [few][524512] [bugs][524510] [later][524509], I finally
had `setxkbmap` spit out the right `xkb_keymap` and could install the
new keyboard map with `xkbcomp`, like so:

    ::sh
    setxkbmap -I$HOME/.xkb […] -print | xkbcomp -I$HOME/xkb - :0

I wrote [a small script to automatically do that at the start of the X
session][] and could have gone to play outside, if it hadn't been for
the itch I felt due to the entire rule file stored in my
configuration. I certainly did not like that, but I could also not
find a way to extend a rule file with additional rules.

When I looked at the aforementioned script again, it suddenly became
obvious that I was going a far longer path than I had to. Even though
the rule system is powerful and allows me to e.g. automatically
include symbol maps to remap keys on my ThinkPad, based on the
keyboard model I configured, the benefit (if any) did not justify the
additional complexity.

In the end, I simplified [the script that loads the keyboard map][],
and defined [a default xkb_keymap][], as well as [one for the
ThinkPad][], which I identify by its fully-qualified hostname. If a
specific file is available for a given host, it is used. Otherwise,
the script uses the default.
