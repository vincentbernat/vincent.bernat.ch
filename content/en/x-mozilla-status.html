[Thunderbird][] stores mails in the [mbox format][]. In addition to
the header lines set by the MUA or by the MTAs in transit, Thunderbird
stores the message status in two headers: `X-Mozilla-Status` and
`X-Mozilla-Status2`. These headers are hexadecimal representations of
the message flags.

The content of the following tables are extracted from the [source
code][] of Thunderbird 102.
