All my projects are hosted on [GitHub][]. Here are a few of them:

 - [lldpd][1] is a [802.1AB][2] daemon. It sends and receives *LLDP*
   frames which enables remote L2 equipments to determine which
   equipment is remotely present. These frames contain information
   like the equipment name, the port name, VLAN, etc.

 - [Akvorado][] is a flow collector and visualizer. It receives flows
   (Netflow/IPFIX and sFlow), hydrates them with interface names
   (using SNMP), geo-related information (using MaxMind databases),
   and exports them to Kafka, then ClickHouse. It also exposes a web
   interface to browse the collected data. Check the [demo website][]!

 - [network-lab][8] is a disparate set of networking labs I maintain
   to test various stuff. Many articles on my blog are backed by such
   a lab. See "[Network lab with QEMU][]" for details.

 - [hellogopher][7] is a `Makefile` for Go projects. See "[A Makefile
   for your Go project][]" for details.

 - [Snimpy][6] is a Python tool targeted at writing simple tools
   using SNMP queries. It features a very pythonic interface and any
   Python developer should feel at home with it. Have a look at
   "[Snimpy: SNMP & Python][]" for details.

 - [eudyptula-boot][11] boots a Linux kernel in a VM without a
   dedicated root filesystem. It's useful for quick tests or to
   develop and debug around the Linux kernel. See "[Eudyptula
   Challenge: superfast Linux kernel booting][]" for details.

 - [jchroot][10] is an enhanced chroot using Linux namespaces to
   provide more isolation. See "[jchroot: chroot with more
   isolation][]" for details.

 - [Wiremaps][9] is a network discovery application. It will browse
   your network and gather information from LLDP, EDP, CDP, FDB and
   ARP tables using SNMP. It also includes a wayback machine to know
   where an equipment was plugged before it disappeared. It's
   unfortunately currently unmaintained.

 - [Dashkiosk][4] is a solution to manage dashboards on multiple
   screens. It provides an administration interface and a set of
   receivers, including a web application, an Android application, and
   a Chromecast application. See "[Dashkiosk: manage dashboards on
   multiple displays][]" for details. It is currently unmaintained.
