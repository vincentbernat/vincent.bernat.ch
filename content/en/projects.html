All my projects are hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/vincentbernat). Here is a few of them:

# lldpd

*[lldpd][1]* is a [802.1AB][2] daemon. It sends and receives *LLDP*
frames which enables remote L2 equipments to determine which equipment
is remotely present. Those frames contain information like the
equipment name, the portname, VLAN, etc. This daemon features SNMP
support and also supports additional protocols like [CDP][3], SONMP
and EDP.

Here is an example of output:

    Interface: tun-cisco
     ChassisID: ciscotest (local)
     SysName:   ciscotest
     SysDescr:  
       cisco 7206VXR running on
       Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software

# Wiremaps

*[wiremaps][4]* is a web application similar to [NetDisco][5]. Its
main aim is to answer questions about your network like "where is
this machine plugged in my datacenter" or "what equipment is
plugged on the port 10 of this switch". Various bit of information
are retrieved using SNMP such as LLDP, FDB and ARP databases.

There is no formal release of Wiremaps. You need to download it from
Github.

# snimpy
   
*[snimpy][6]* is a Python tool targeted at writting simple tool using
SNMP queries. It features a very pythonic interface. Any Python
developer should feel at home with it. Here is a use example:

    ::python
    load("IP-FORWARD-MIB")
    m=M()

    print "Using IP-FORWARD-MIB::ipCidrRouteTable..."
    routes = m.ipCidrRouteNextHop
    for x in routes:
         net, netmask, tos, src = x
         print "%15s/%-15s via %-15s src %-15s" % (net, netmask, routes[x], src)
