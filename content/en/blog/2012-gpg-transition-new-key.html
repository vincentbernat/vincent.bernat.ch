I am transitioning my GPG key from an old 1024-bit DSA key to a new
4096-bit RSA key.  The old key will continue to be valid for some time
but I prefer all new correspondence to be encrypted with the new
key. I will be making all signatures going forward with the new key.

I have followed the [excellent tutorial from Daniel Kahn Gillmor][]
which also explains why this migration is needed. The only step that I
did not execute is issuing a new certification for keys I have signed
in the past. I did not find any search engine to tell me which key I
have signed.

Here is the signed transition statement (stolen [from Zack][]):

    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
    Hash: SHA256,SHA1

    I am transitioning GPG keys from an old 1024-bit DSA key to a new
    4096-bit RSA key.  The old key will continue to be valid for some
    time, but I prefer all new correspondance to be encrypted in the new
    key, and will be making all signatures going forward with the new key.

    This transition document is signed with both keys to validate the
    transition.

    If you have signed my old key, I would appreciate signatures on my new
    key as well, provided that your signing policy permits that without
    reauthenticating me.

    The old key, which I am transitional away from, is:

      pub   1024D/F22A794E 2001-03-23
          Key fingerprint = 5854 AF2B 65B2 0E96 2161  E32B 285B D7A1 F22A 794E

    The new key, to which I am transitioning, is:

      pub   4096R/353525F9 2012-06-16 [expires: 2014-06-16]
          Key fingerprint = AEF2 3487 66F3 71C6 89A7  3600 95A4 2FE8 3535 25F9

    To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

      gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 95A42FE8353525F9

    If you have already validated my old key, you can then validate that
    the new key is signed by my old key:

      gpg --check-sigs 95A42FE8353525F9

    If you then want to sign my new key, a simple and safe way to do that
    is by using caff (shipped in Debian as part of the "signing-party"
    package) as follows:

      caff 95A42FE8353525F9

    Please contact me via e-mail at <vincent@bernat.im> if you have any
    questions about this document or this transition.

For easier access, I have also published it in text format. You can
check it with:

    ::console
    $ gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 95A42FE8353525F9
    gpg: requesting key 353525F9 from hkp server keys.gnupg.net
    gpg: key 353525F9: "Vincent Bernat <bernat@luffy.cx>" not changed
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:              unchanged: 1
    $ curl https://media.luffy.cx/files/key-transition-2012.txt | \
            gpg --verify

To avoid signing/encrypting with the old key who share the same email
addresses than the new one, I have saved it, removed it from the
keyring and added it again. The new key is now first in both the
secret and the public keyrings and will be used whenever the
appropriate email address is requested.

    ::console
    $ gpg --export-secret-keys F22A794E > ~/tmp/secret
    $ gpg --export F22A794E > ~/tmp/public
    $ gpg --delete-secret-key F22A794

    Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
    (by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

      1 = I don't know or won't say
      2 = I do NOT trust
      3 = I trust marginally
      4 = I trust fully
      5 = I trust ultimately
      m = back to the main menu

    Your decision? 5
    Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y    

I now need to gather some signatures for the new key. If this is
appropriate for you, please sign the new key if you signed the old
one.
