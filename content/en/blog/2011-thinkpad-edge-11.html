This has been several months since I didn't use much my laptop, an
Asus S5N: it was crippled by a short battery life and was hit by
several bugs, most of them targeting the i855GME graphic chipset
thanks to the use of [GEM][2] and [KMS][3] in the latest Xorg. I did
not want to invest too much in a laptop and I have found
[a rebate from Lenovo for Thinkpad Edge series][1]. Voilà, I have a
[Thinkpad Edge 11"][4].

# Hardware

Thinkpad Edge is a entry-level notebook from Lenovo. In France, it is
available for around 500 €, thanks to the usual parity between dollar
and euro.

{% from "macros.j2" import gallery with context %}
{{ gallery("thinkpad-edge","Lenovo Thinkpad Edge") }}

## Hardware configuration

Lenovo do not sell directly in France. Therefore, you cannot configure
your laptop as you want. There is two or three configurations
available. This can be a bit frustrating if you want something
specific.

Here is the configuration that I bought:

 * [Intel Core i3][5] 380UM at 1.33 GHz CPU.
 * 11.6" LED screen, with a resolution of 1366x768.
 * 4 GB RAM.
 * 320 GB hard drive.
 * Wireless network (Centrino Wireless-N) and bluetooth.
 * Broadband modem (WWAN)

It's a small laptop but it is not as light as it should be (1.5 kg or
3.3 pounds). Apart from the power supply, you don't get any extra. My
Asus was shipped with a wireless mouse, a transport bag, a sleeve, an
USB key and a CD burner.

On one side, you get two USB ports and on the other side, one USB
port, an HDMI port, a network outlet and a speaker jack. The VGA
connector is placed on the rear.

## BIOS

First step: checking BIOS settings. WiMAX can be disabled as well as
any other component that you may not need. The keyboard can be
configured so that function keys are available directly instead of
having to use the _Fn_ key.

There is an option called _Computrace_ from [AbsoluteSoftware][6]
which seems targeted at find back your laptop in case it gets stolen
or just let the FBI know where you are. I have disabled it.

# Debian installation

[Debian][7] can be installed from an USB stick. This is really easy
now. You grab the ISO image you want to use (I take the
[one for AMD64 in testing][8] because I will run _unstable_) and to
copy it on the USB stick:

    ::console
    # dd if=debian-testing-amd64-netinst.iso of=/dev/sdb

The previous way of making the USB stick bootable, installing a
kernel, an initrd and the ISO image is deprecated (and does not work).

Moreover, using _testing_ to install Debian allows me to use a 2.6.37
kernel and circumvent some problems that may have happen with an older
kernel.

During the installation, I choose a guided partitioning using
encrypted LVM. I choose to have several partitions but I keep `/usr`
in the root partition since having a separate `/usr` is less and less
supported, especially with piece of software like `udev`.

The partitioning tool in Debian installer does not allow you to resize
volumes, you need to destroy them and recreate them as well as their
content. However, this is still faster than writing a patch for this.

When the installation is finished, the laptop boots on a 2.6.38
kernel, asks for the passphrase to decrypt the LUKS volume and display
the login prompt a few seconds later.

# Software configuration

Most of the hardware seems to be supported. No obscure commands to run
to get a working network. Therefore, I start by setting up my usual
environment.

## Setting up the desktop

First, I change `/etc/apt/sources.list` to get _unstable_:

    deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ unstable main
    deb-src http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ unstable main
    deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ experimental main contrib non-free

I also want that everything that is installed from _experimental_ to
be upgraded if an update is available in _experimental_. This is done
by creating a file `/etc/apt/preferences.d/experimental`:

    Package: *
    Pin: release experimental
    Pin-Priority: 101

Then, I install the following packages:

 * `zsh`, my favourite shell with my hand-made maturating
   configuration. I should put it on
   [GitHub](https://github.com/vincentbernat) one day.
 * `mg`, is the editor that I use to quickly edit a configuration
   file. I don't like `vi`. I have used `jed` for a long time but its
   default configuration can be cumbersome and it misses some emacs
   keybinding.
 * `emacs`, my work environment. I use it as a text editor and mail
   reader (with [Gnus](http://www.gnus.org)). I don't use it as a
   browser nor as a terminal. As for `zsh`, I have my configuration
   files ready to be copied anywhere.
 * `fvwm`, my window manager since quite some time. I use
   `fvwm-crystal` on top of it. My configuration is
   [described in another post][fvwm]. I also use `conky`.
 * `rxvt-unicode`, a terminal. It has a very good terminal emulation
   and some fancy features like transparency (using compositing or
   not). It is light and fast and allows me to search in the
   backbuffer. It can use a client/server system that will close all
   your windows when the server crashes. This almost never happens.
 * `unison`, a synchronisation tool that allows me to keep the same
   files on my different computers.
 * `gdm3` is the only display manager that is able to talk correctly
   to _ConsoleKit_ and get the rights set correctly without adding
   yourself to a lot of groups.

[fvwm]: [[en/blog/2011-fvwm-configuration.html]]

Nowadays, I use the kernel from Debian and I do not have to run my own
configuration for it. The glory days where I had to recompile the
kernel before plugging a new USB toy have passed.

I remove `rpcbind` and `nfs-common`. I use `ferm` to setup a simple
firewall. Here is my `ferm.conf`:

    domain (ip ip6) {
      table filter {
	chain INPUT {
	    policy DROP;
	    mod state state INVALID DROP;
	    mod state state (ESTABLISHED RELATED) ACCEPT;
	    interface lo ACCEPT;
	    proto tcp dport ssh ACCEPT;
	}   
	chain OUTPUT {
	    policy ACCEPT;
	    mod state state (ESTABLISHED RELATED) ACCEPT;
	}   
	chain FORWARD {
	    policy DROP;
	}   
      }  
    }

`unison` will then sync my configuration files and my documents. After
this step, my environment is ready.

## Hardware configuration

This is usually the most troublesome part. However, looking at the
output of `lspci` and `lsusb`, everything seems pretty easy to get
supported.

Here is `lspci` output:

There is
[a dedicated page for the Thinkpad Edge 11" on ThinkWiki][10]. This
wiki is one of the best source of information when you get a Thinkpad.

The kernel as shipped by Debian kernel team contains every module that
you may need. One of them, `thinkpad_acpi` will handle most of the
perks under the hood.

I do not use a complete desktop like Gnome. I usually prefer to use
command line tools and put them in `.xsession` for persistence. There
is usually some graphical utility to do the same thing. There are
however some configuration steps that are now far easier to do with a
graphical tool. Since I use X all the time, I just rely on those tools
when necessary.

### BIOS upgrade

From `lshw` output, I see that I already have the latest BIOS
available. No need to update then. In case you need to update, yours,
ThinkWiki has a [documentation to upgrade][biosupgrade]. You can find
`memdisk` image in `syslinux` package.

[biosupgrade]: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_Upgrade#Booting_using_GRUB

### Graphic card

The graphic card is integrated into the CPU. Intel usually ships
graphic cards well supported by open source drivers. [ThinkWiki][12]
tells us:

> A very recent Linux distribution with kernel 2.6.33 and Intel Xorg
> driver 2.11 or newer is recommended. Note that XVideo (Xv) playback
> at certain frame sizes does not work properly unless you have at
> least version 2.12 of the Intel Xorg driver.

With Debian Wheezy, you get version 2.15. Therefore, configuring the
graphic card is just a matter of installing `xserver-xorg-video-intel`
and that's all. No `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` needed.

HDMI and VGA outputs are detected without configuring anything. They
can be enabled with `xrandr`. I did not try if it was possible to use
both of them at the same time.

    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1366 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192
    LVDS1 connected 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 256mm x 144mm
       1366x768       60.0*+   50.0  
       1360x768       59.8     60.0  
       1024x768       60.0  
       800x600        60.3     56.2  
       640x480        59.9  
    VGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    HDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    DP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)

Compositing works without any problem. I use only transparency and
therefore, I don't know what the speed is on a desktop with all
effects turned on.

Regarding video acceleration, _XVideo_ is supported but the graphic
card also features hardware decoding with `i965-va-driver`
package. Here is the output of `vainfo`:

    libva: libva version 0.32.0
    libva: va_getDriverName() returns 0
    libva: Trying to open /usr/lib/dri/i965_drv_video.so
    libva: va_openDriver() returns 0
    vainfo: VA API version: 0.32
    vainfo: Driver version: i965 Driver 0.1
    vainfo: Supported profile and entrypoints
	  VAProfileMPEG2Simple            :	VAEntrypointVLD
	  VAProfileMPEG2Main              :	VAEntrypointVLD
	  VAProfileH264Baseline           :	VAEntrypointVLD
	  VAProfileH264Main               :	VAEntrypointVLD
	  VAProfileH264High               :	VAEntrypointVLD

With Debian, [VLC][VLC] can make use of this if you put `ffmpeg-hw=1`
in your `~/.config/vlc/vlcrc`. We are then greeted by this:

    [0x2629040] avcodec decoder: Using VA API version 0.32 for hardware decoding.

[VLC]: http://www.videolan.org

### Network

The network card works out of the box. [ThinkWiki][13] tells us that
there can be stability problems with 2.6.36 kernel. During the
installation, a 2.6.37 was used without any problem. I am now running
a 2.6.38 and never got a glitch. It is likely that the described
problem was solved with 2.6.37.

### UltraNav

[UltraNav][15] is the combination of the usual touchpad and the
[trackpoint][16] which is a small joystick in the center of the
keyboard and is well known to Thinkpad users since most of them have
one. The trackpoint is a great input device.

Nowadays, all input devices are configured with the help of `xinput`
command. Here is the output of `xinput list`:

    ⎡ Virtual core pointer                    	id=2	[master pointer  (3)]
    ⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer              	id=4	[slave  pointer  (2)]
    ⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad              	id=11	[slave  pointer  (2)]
    ⎜   ↳ TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint                   	id=12	[slave  pointer  (2)]
    ⎣ Virtual core keyboard                   	id=3	[master keyboard (2)]
	↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard             	id=5	[slave  keyboard (3)]
	↳ Power Button                            	id=6	[slave  keyboard (3)]
	↳ Video Bus                               	id=7	[slave  keyboard (3)]
	↳ Power Button                            	id=8	[slave  keyboard (3)]
	↳ Integrated Camera                       	id=9	[slave  keyboard (3)]
	↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard            	id=10	[slave  keyboard (3)]
	↳ ThinkPad Extra Buttons                  	id=13	[slave  keyboard (3)]

The command `xinput list-props` will give you additional information
on each input device listed above. You can then configure any settings
using `xinput set-prop`. For example, if you want to enable scrolling
by using the edges of the touchpad and enable palm detection, you can
use the following commands:

    ::console
    $ xinput set-int-prop "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" 'Synaptics Edge Scrolling' 8 1 1 0
    $ xinput set-int-prop "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" 'Synaptics Palm Detection' 8 1

If you want to disable the touchpad and only use the trackpoint, use
the following command:

    ::console
    $ xinput set-int-prop "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" 'Synaptics Off' 8 1

Each property has a type and a size. There is no place for guessing
since every property is listed in `man 4 synaptics`. The same applies
for the trackpoint but the correct manual page is `man 4 evdev`. For
example, if you want to enable scrolling using the middle button, use:

    ::console
    $ xinput set-int-prop "TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint" "Evdev Wheel Emulation" 8 1
    $ xinput set-int-prop "TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint" "Evdev Wheel Emulation Button" 8 2

All those commands can be tossed in `~/.xsession`.

### Keyboard hot keys

Thinkpad laptops usually have a lot of hot keys. This is not the case
of the Thinkpad Edge which only features a few of them:

 * volume control
 * brightness control
 * webcam and external screen toggle
 * wireless toggle
 * multimedia keys

All those keys trigger an event in one of the keyboard listed in
`xinput list`. Therefore, your window manager or any other application
can intercept them and act upon. You can use `evtest` to check which
key triggers which event on which keyboard.

The `acpid` daemon listen on those keyboards and can also trigger some
actions. For example, it will run `ibm-wireless.sh` when you hit the
wireless toggle. By default, this will enable or disable your wireless
card. But you can configure the script to use a multistate toggle and
disable or enable the bluetooth card as well.

### Sound card

As for the network card, the sound card works out of the box.

I use [PulseAudio][17] because it allows per-application volume
control and per-application sound card selection. It comes handy if
you have some bluetooth headset. To make PulseAudio the default
application for most applications, I put this in my `~/.asoundrc`:

    pcm.!default {
      type pulse
    }

    ctl.!default {
      type pulse
    }

### Wireless card

A firmware is needed to make this card work. On Debian, you need to
install `firmware-iwlwifi` package. Then, `iwlagn` module needs to be
loaded. You can check with `rfkill list` that the wireless card has
not been disabled. `iw list` will then give the status:

I don't know why, but 802.11a channels have been disabled. I don't
have interest in them and therefore I did not search why this happens.

Wireless is one of the thing that make me use graphical applications
like _Network Manager_. Command line tools are too low level to
quickly connect to some random wireless network.

There was a large debate in [debian-devel@ldo][ddldo] to determine if
_Network Manager_ was ready to replace `ifup` and `ifdown` commands,
even for servers. It seems that this is not something impossible and
therefore, I think it has become flexible enough to ensure most of the
configuration tasks I need.

[ddldo]: http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg00051.html

### Bluetooth

The bluetooth chipset is hosted on the USB bus. `hci_usb` module will
take care of it. It supports AD2P and can be used to listen to music
with a compatible headset. `hciconfig` will tell us if the chipset is
working.

Again, bluetooth is easier to configure with a graphical
tool. [BlueZ][19], the bluetooth stack in Linux, uses DBus to
communicate with other applications. The command line tools have been
deprecated and therefore, you need to fight with some DBus binding to
pair your computer to your headset.

`gnome-bluetooth` package comes with an applet which allows you to
quickly pair to any device. If you install
`pulseaudio-module-bluetooth` package, any bluetooth headset should
work out of the box.

### Broadband (WWAN)

To configure the broadband modem, the most difficult thing to do is to
grab the appropriate firmware. [ThinkWiki][gobi] comes with various
instructions to get it. I did not keep my Windows installation and
therefore, I grabbed the
[Qualcomm Gobi 2000 Wireless WAN driver][qualcomm] and I unpacked it
with some Windows host with `msiexec` as instructed (I did have to
execute the installation program first, otherwise, `msiexec` tells
that the file is invalid). I choosed the default firmware since my
laptop is unlocked. [ThinkWiki page][gobi] explains which firmware to
choose in which situation.

The package `gobi-loader` needs to be installed. The firmware files
`amss.mbn`, `apps.mbn` and `UQCN.mbn` should be placed in
`/lib/firmware/gobi`. They will be loaded by `udev`. To avoid to
reboot, I used this command:

    ::console
    # /lib/udev/gobi_loader -2000 /dev/ttyUSB0 /lib/firmware/gobi

To configure the 3G connection, I just used *Network Manager*. Ensure
with `rfkill list` that your WWAN card is not blocked. I did
not test the GPS part that needs to be enabled on Windows.

[gobi]: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Gobi_2000
[qualcomm]: http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/MIGR-72938.html

### Webcam

Nowadays, USB webcam are UVC device and there is a
[driver to support this class of devices][18]. Check that the
`uvcvideo` module is correctly loaded and you should have something
like this in your `dmesg`:

    uvcvideo: Found UVC 1.00 device Integrated Camera (5986:01a7)

`cheese` is a small application that can be used to check if the
webcam operates as expected.

### Card reader

Nothing to do. This works out of the box.

### Suspend to memory and disk

Install the `uswsusp` package which will also pull `pm-utils`. You
will get `pm-suspend` and `pm-hibernate` commands.

`pm-suspend` will enable suspend to memory. On resume, the system
takes a whole minute to become operational. I get the following
message:

    r8169 0000:09:00.0: eth0: unable to apply firmware patch
    PM: resume of devices complete after 60786.035 msecs
    PM: Finishing wakeup.

Installing `firmware-realtek` package solves this issue. It should
also be solved by a future kernel. I also have this message when I
come back from sleep:

    [drm:i915_hangcheck_ring_idle] *ERROR* Hangcheck timer elapsed... render ring idle [waiting on 9297, at 9297], missed IRQ?

The X server is then slow as hell. The message can be fixed by using
`i915.semaphores=1` as a kernel parameter but the X server is still
slow. It seems that running `powertop` restores the original
speed. This is a [known problem][slow].

[slow]: http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2011-March/009579.html

On sleep, the battery loses 2% every 6 hours. This allows you to keep
your laptop on sleep for several days if needed.

`pm-hibernate` enable suspend to disk. The suspend part works well but
on resume, the kernel freezes after reading back the image into
memory. There are some [documentation to debug this problem][debug]
but I prefer to wait for 2.6.39 which may just solves this issue.

### Power management

Let's see on how we could enhance battery life. First, `cpufrequtils`
package will slow down the processor when it is not used by using the
`ondemand` governor. The frequency will drop from 1.33 GHz to 666 MHz.

Several tools are then available:

 * `pm-utils` package comes with scripts to enable some powersaving
   features. Those scripts are run on ACPI events (for example, when
   you unplug the AC adapater). There is no way to put the laptop to
   sleep after two hours of inactivity for example. You need something
   like `sleepd` to handle this part. I have found nothing that could
   dim the screen on inactivity.
 * `laptop-mode-tools` is also a set of script to be run on ACPI
   events. It is therefore somewhat superseded by `pm-utils`.
 * `gnome-power-manager` is a daemon that makes use of
   `upowerd`. Despite its name, you can run it outside of the Gnome
   environment. It will put your laptop to sleep on inactivity and
   will dim the screen when needed. All other functionalities are
   handled to `upowerd`. This seems the way to go on today Linux
   desktops.

**UPDATED:** Check my article about
[GNOME Power Manager without a GNOME desktop][gpm] to know all the
cons about running GNOME Power Manager without running a full-blown
GNOME desktop.

[gpm]: [[en/blog/2011-gnome-power-manager.html]]

Behing the scene, `upowerd` will call at some point `pm-powersave`
from `pm-utils`. This allows you to run scripts when unplugging the AC
adapter. There are some scripts shipped in
`/usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d`. You can add your own in
`/etc/pm/power.d`. Some scripts are configurable. For example, if you
create `/etc/pm/config.d/local` and put `SATA_ALPM_ENABLE=true` in it,
this will enable SATA ALPM mode on battery.

You can check what needs to be done with `powertop` or go to a website
like [Less Watts][lesswatts] to get some tips on what to configure to
get a better battery life.

Without adding any script, I get 5 hours of battery life with the
laptop doing almost nothing. Lenovo tells that you should get 6 hours
of battery life. I think that on moderate workloads, you should get 4 hours.

# Conclusion

This Lenovo Edge has a good value for money. It features a great
keyboard for a laptop of its size. It could be lighter and
thinner. Its battery life is pretty good.

Almost everything works out of the box with GNU/Linux. I hope that
2.6.39 kernel will solve the remaining issues like the suspend on disk
issue.
