!!! "TL;DR" Each of Linux 2.6.39, 3.6 and 4.0 brings notable
performance improvements for the IPv4 route lookup process.

In a [previous article][IPv4 route lookup on Linux], I explained how
Linux implements an IPv4 routing table with compressed tries to offer
excellent lookup times. The following graph shows the performance
progression of Linux through history:

![IPv4 route lookup performance][i3]
[i3]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-perf-v2.svg]] "Route lookup times for various Linux kernel versions. Lookup is done on a table with 500,000 routes. Notable performance improvements are highlighted."

Two scenarios are tested:

 - 500,000 routes extracted from an Internet router (half of them are
   /24), and
 - 500,000 host routes (/32) tightly packed in 4 distinct subnets.

All kernels are compiled with *GCC* 4.9 (from *Debian Jessie*). This
version is able to compile older kernels[^old] as well as current
ones. The kernel configuration used is the default one with
`CONFIG_SMP` and `CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES` options enabled (however,
no IP rules are used). Some other unrelated options are enabled to be
able to boot them in a virtual machine and run the benchmark.

[^old]: Compiling old kernels with an updated userland may
    still require some [small][p2] [patches][p3].

The measurements are done in a virtual machine with one
vCPU.[^smp] The host is an [Intel Core i5-4670K][] and the CPU
governor was set to "performance." The benchmark is
single-threaded. Implemented as a [kernel module][], it calls
`fib_lookup()` with various destinations in 100,000 timed iterations
and keeps the median. Timings of individual runs are computed from the
TSC (and converted to nanoseconds by assuming a constant clock).

[^smp]: The kernels are compiled with the `CONFIG_SMP` option to use
    the [hierarchical RCU][] and activate more of the same code paths
    as actual routers. However, progress on parallelism are left
    unnoticed.

The following kernel versions bring a notable performance improvement:

 - In Linux **2.6.39**, [commit 3630b7c050d9][], David Miller removes
   the hash-based routing table implementation to switch to the
   LPC-trie implementation (available since Linux 2.6.13 as a
   compile-time option). This brings a small regression for the
   scenario with many host routes but boosts the performance for the
   general case.

 - In Linux **3.0**, [commit 281dc5c5ec0f][], the improvement is not
   related to the network subsystem. Linus Torvalds disables the
   compiler size-optimization from the default configuration. It was
   believed that optimizing for size would help keeping the
   instruction cache efficient. However, compilers generated
   under-performing code on x86 when this option was enabled.

 - In Linux **3.6**, [commit f4530fa574df][], David Miller adds an
   optimization to not evaluate IP rules when they are left
   unconfigured. From this point, the use of the
   `CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES` option doesn't impact the performance
   unless some IP rules are configured. This version also removes
   the [route cache][] ([commit 5e9965c15ba8][]). However, this has no
   effect on the benchmark as it directly calls `fib_lookup()` which
   doesn't involve the cache.

 - In Linux **4.0**, notably [commit 9f9e636d4f89][], Alexander Duyck
   adds several optimizations to the trie lookup algorithm. It really
   pays off!

 - In Linux **4.1**, [commit 0ddcf43d5d4a][], Alexander Duyck
   collapses the local and main tables when no specific IP rules are
   configured. For non-local traffic, both these tables were looked
   up.

# Mid-2018 update

Here is a graph for more recent kernels. Performance is mostly stable.
Measures are done in a batch of 5 successful lookups to reduce
overhead. Small regressions in 4.2 and 4.16 may or may not be
significant—a 5 ns variation matches an L2 cache lookup.

[i4]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-perf-recent-v2.svg]] "Route lookup times for more recent Linux kernel versions. Lookup is done on a table with 500,000 routes. The shaded surfaces represent the median absolute deviation."

The recent [Meltdown and Spectre exploits][] have made headlines due
the performance impact of the various mitigations. Because route
lookup happens entirely in the kernel, the mitigations should have no
effect, as confirmed in the graphs below:

![IPv4 route lookup performance with kernels around the Meltdown/Spectre era]([[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-perf-meltdown-v1.svg]] "Route lookup times for more Linux kernel versions from late 2017 and early 2018. Lookup is done on a table with 500,000 routes. The kernels are ordered by their release date. The shaded area contains kernels without Spectre/Meltdown mitigations.")

![IPv4 route lookup performance with kernels around the Meltdown/Spectre era]([[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-perf-meltdown-v3.svg]] "Same graph as previously but the kernels are ordered by their versions.")

Measures are done in a virtual machine with one vCPU. The host is an
[Intel Core i5-4670K][]—*Haswell* microarchitecture—running at 3.4 GHz
with an up-to-date microcode and a Linux 4.16 kernel from Debian. When
protected, host is using PTI, full generic retpoline and IBPB. When
unprotected, the host is running with an out-of-date microcode and
mitigations are disabled on the command line (`nopti nospectre_v2`).
Kernels for the guest are compiled with GCC 7.3—with *retpoline*
support.
