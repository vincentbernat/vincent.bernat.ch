is reproduced here, translated to English and with very small changes.

Privilege separation[^PROVOS] is a technique popularized by OpenSSH and notably
used in the OpenBSD project, allowing the separation of a program into two
communicating parts. One part handles operations requiring specific privileges
like opening a network socket or opening a file. The other part runs without any
special privileges in a chroot and must perform most of the operations necessary
for the proper functioning of the program. This technique aims to minimize the
number of lines of code requiring privileges and thus the number of lines to be
carefully audited. Adding privilege separation to a program is not necessarily
very complicated. We will see how to create a small sniffer using this
technique.

# A "light" tcpdump

As an example, we will write a lightweight clone of tcpdump. It takes as a
parameter the interface on which to listen. It will display on the standard
output the packets it receives: source IP, destination IP, protocol, and
possibly source and destination ports.

We will also add a feature whose sole purpose will be to better illustrate our
article: regularly, our sniffer will append some statistics to the end of a log
file.

## The code

Here is a first version of our sniffer. This version must be launched as the
root user in order to function.

            switch (ip.protocol) {
            case IPPROTO_UDP:
                memcpy(&udp, packet + 2*ETH_ALEN + 2 + ip.ihl*4,

                break;

            if (nb++ > 20) {
                if ((log = fopen(LOG, "a+")) == NULL) {
                    fprintf(stderr, "unable to open %s (%m)\n", LOG);
                    exit(1);
                }

                fprintf(log, "%s: %ld: %d packets received\n",
                        argv[0], time(NULL), nb);
                fclose(log);
                nb = 0;
            }
        }
    }

Let's see step by step how our sniffer works:

In ❶, a level 2 *socket* (`AF_PACKET`) in raw mode (`SOCK_RAW`) is first opened.
This type of socket allows receiving all packets arriving on a network
interface, without alteration. Then, we associate our socket with the physical
interface on which we want to retrieve the packets.

In ❷, we then attach a filter to only bring up certain packets. This filter has
only an educational purpose and avoids bringing up *broadcast* packets. It is a
filter written in BPF. The comment indicates the `tcpdump` command used to
obtain this filter.

In ❸, For each received packet, we extract some relevant information to display
to the user.

Finally, every 20 packets, in ❹, we open a log file to indicate that, at such a
moment, we received about twenty packets. This is also a purely educational
feature that will complicate our task later on.

To compile our program, we use the following command:

    ::sh
    cc -Wall -Werror -O0 -g -o sniffer1 sniffer1.c

By executing it and providing the name of an interface as the first argument, we
obtain the expected information. We can also verify that the file specified at
the top of the code is indeed created with the date information and the number
of packets received.

    10.0.2.2 -> 87.248.120.129 : protocol 1
    87.248.120.129 -> 10.0.2.2 : protocol 1
    10.0.2.2 -> 10.0.2.1 : UDP [port 49118 -> port 53]
    10.0.2.1 -> 10.0.2.2 : UDP [port 53 -> port 49118]
    10.0.2.2 -> 87.248.120.129 : protocol 1
    87.248.120.129 -> 10.0.2.2 : protocol 1
    10.0.2.2 -> 10.0.2.1 : UDP [port 58886 -> port 53]
    10.0.2.1 -> 10.0.2.2 : UDP [port 53 -> port 58886]

In our example, we captured the result of the `ping` command.

## Why add privilege separation?

Let's imagine we add a bit more code to our sniffer to display more information,
similar to `tcpdump`. All this code would run with root privileges. The past has
shown that it's not uncommon to find, in this type of application,
vulnerabilities leading at best to a crash of the application[^vuln] and at
worst to remote code execution.

[^vuln]: There is actually such a vulnerability in our sniffer,
    can you find it?

It would be interesting to minimize the impact of such a vulnerability by
executing only the strict minimum with elevated privileges.

Indeed, in the code above, very few things require privileges:

- the [`socket()`][socket] function followed by the [`bind()`][bind] function, and
- the [`fopen()`][fopen] function.

All other calls can function without accessing the file system (so for example
in an empty chroot) and without using any particular privileges (such as those
of root), including for example the implementation of a filter.

If we were able to execute the rest of the code in a chroot with a user without
any privileges, an attacker who would take control of our sniffer using a
specially crafted packet could not do much: they could not execute a shell, they
could not read files, and they could not execute any privileged function. Even
exploiting a kernel flaw would become difficult in this case.

## Poor man's privilege separation

There is a very simple way to achieve privilege separation: drop root rights
very early, for example just after the call to [`bind()`][bind].

We use the following code to drop all privileges. This code can be placed after
the `bind()` call:

    ::c
    if ((user = getpwnam("nobody")) == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "no user `nobody'\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    uid = user->pw_uid;

    if ((group = getgrnam("nogroup")) == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "no group `nogroup'\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    gid = group->gr_gid;

    if (chroot("/var/empty") == -1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "unable to chroot (%m)\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    if (chdir("/") != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "unable to chdir (%m)\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    gidset[0] = gid;
    if ((setresgid(gid, gid, gid) == -1) ||
        (setgroups(1, gidset) == -1) ||
        (setresuid(uid, uid, uid) == -1)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "unable to drop privileges (%m)\n");
        exit(1);
    }

Let's see exactly what this code does and why each line is useful. First, it's
important to test the result of each call. Indeed, if we fail to change users,
we remain root and it would then be easier to exit the chroot. Similarly, if we
fail to set up the chroot, we access important information. It is therefore
vital to properly test the result of each function!

We first obtain the UID of the `nobody` user. We will indeed run the rest of the
process under this user. This is an easy solution to avoid having to create a
specific user, but it diminishes the protection we want to achieve. Indeed, this
user has some privileges, notably that of potentially having other processes
running under its name or files that belong to it. An attacker could then, even
in the chroot, attach to another process of the same user, a process that might
not be confined in a chroot, and thus gain additional rights. It is therefore
important to create a user specific to your application, for example `_sniffer`
in our case.

Similarly, we retrieve the GID of the `nogroup` group. Again, in real life, you
should create a group specific to your application, for example `_sniffer`.

We confine ourselves in the `/var/empty` directory, which as its name suggests
must be empty. Moreover, it must belong to root and have adequate permissions so
that it's not possible to create files there. Placing oneself in a chroot
requires root rights, which explains why we perform this operation before
dropping root rights.

We move to the root of our chroot. Indeed, without this call to
[`chdir()`][chdir], our application would still be located in its startup
directory.

We then lose the rights related to the group and then to the user. In a single
call, the [`setresgid()`][setresgid] and [`setresuid()`][setresuid] functions
allow changing the real, effective, and saved user or group. Indeed, when a
process is root, it can temporarily lose its privileges, for example with
[`setuid()`][setuid], but also regain them later with `seteuid()`. It is
therefore important to abandon any possibility of going back. Otherwise, an
attacker will know how to make good use of it.

To run this example, don't forget to create the `/var/empty` directory. After
compilation, the new program works like the old one, but can no longer write the
statistics to the intended file. Indeed, not only is the file not accessible
from the chroot, but it belongs to root.

A solution to circumvent this difficulty would be to open this file while we are
root. It would then be possible to write to it without any particular rights.
But that would be too easy: we absolutely want to open this file each time we
want to write to it because, for example, a `logrotate` might have processed it.

We are then in a classic situation where the simple loss of privileges does not
solve our problem.

# Privilege separation

In order to occasionally write to a file, we need to split our application into
two distinct processes. One process will run as root and the other in a chroot
without any privileges. The two processes will communicate via a pair of
sockets.

## A first attempt

Here, in pseudo-code, is how it would be possible to write our sniffer using two
separate processes.

    ::c
    int pair[2];

    /* Get a pair of socket */
    socketpair(AF_LOCAL, SOCK_DGRAM, PF_UNSPEC, pair);

    /* Create monitored process */
    switch (fork()) {
    case 0:
        /* In the child, chroot and drop privileges */
        chroot("/var/empty");
        chdir("/");
        setresgid("nogroup");
        setgroups("nogroup");
        setresuid("nobody");
        close(pair[1]);
        break;

    default:
        /* In the parent */
        close(pair[0]);
        while (1) {
            recv_child(cmd);
            switch (cmd.id) {
            case OPENSOCKET:
                s = socket();
                bind(s, cmd.arg);
                setsockopt(s, filter);
                break;

            case GETPACKET:
                n = recvfrom(s, packet);
                write_child(n, packet);
                break;

            case OPENLOGFILE:
                log = fopen("/var/log/sniffer.log");
                break;

            case WRITETOLOGFILE:
                fprintf(log, cmd.arg);
                break;

            case CLOSELOGFILE:
                fclose(log);
                break;

            }

            exit(0);
        }
    }

    /* At this point, we don't have any privilege */
    cmd = {
        .id = OPENSOCKET,
        .arg = ifname
    };
    write_parent(cmd);

    while (1) {
        cmd = {
            .id = GETPACKET,
            .arg = NULL
        };
        write_parent(cmd);

        n = recv_parent(packet, MFS);
        process_packet(packet, n);
        if (nb++ > 20) {
            cmd = {
                .id = OPENLOGFILE,
                .arg = NULL
            };
            write_parent(cmd);

            cmd = {
                .id = WRITETOLOGFILE,
                .arg = "..."
            };
            write_parent(cmd);

            cmd = {
                .id = CLOSELOGFILE,
                .arg = NULL
            };
            write_parent(cmd);
        }
    }

First, we create a pair of sockets that we'll use as bidirectional pipes: what
we write on one of the sockets is received on the other side and vice versa. We
use Unix sockets (`AF_UNIX`), anonymous ([`socketpair()`][socketpair] can't do
anything else) and datagram-oriented (`SOCK_DGRAM`). This last characteristic is
very interesting because, unlike stream-oriented sockets, it preserves message
boundaries (if we send 10 bytes, we read 10 bytes on the other side and not 7
then 3) and, in the context of Unix sockets, they are reliable and do not
reorder messages (which is not the case for IP sockets, as this corresponds to
the UDP protocol). The two processes can therefore communicate through this
means using a predetermined protocol in a relatively simple manner.

Then, in the parent process, we retain root privileges and wait to receive
orders from the child that we execute. These orders consist of:

- opening the socket, associating it with the appropriate interface and setting
  the filter,
- opening the log file,
- writing to the log file, and
- closing the log file.

An important point to note is that it is not possible from the child to choose
the log file to open. It is crucial not to turn the parent into a simple proxy.
If the child could choose the name of the log file, an attacker could, for
example, ask to open `/etc/passwd` and create an account! It is critical to
consider the child as hostile, as potentially controlled by the attacker, as in
a client/server application!

Also, the parent has a formidable weapon that a classic client/server
application does not have: it can kill its child if it considers that it is not
behaving correctly, thus putting an end to any attack. Certainly, in our case,
the sniffer will then cease to function, but since it was controlled by an
attacker anyway, it could no longer accomplish its task.

In the child, we have replaced the calls requiring particular privileges with a
message send to the parent process to execute the necessary actions. Moreover,
we have also moved some non-privileged calls such as setting up a filter and
reading a packet: only the parent has access to the socket and the child must
therefore tell the parent what it wants to do.

In our previous example, setting up a filter and reading a packet did not
require any privileges. We have therefore regressed on this point: additional
code is executed as root. However, we can again write our log file, but almost
all of the necessary code is actually executed by root.

One of the interests of privilege separation is to drastically reduce the code
running as root, thus reducing the amount of code to carefully audit. In our
example, there is too much code running as root (for such a simple example).
Fortunately, there is a solution.

## Passing file descriptors in sockets

Unix sockets implement a feature essential to privilege separation. They indeed
allow passing file descriptors, that is, duplicating a file descriptor in the
receiving process's space (a kind of inter-process `dup()`). In our previous
example, the child had to ask the parent to receive each packet for it. Now, we
can adopt the following approach:

- The child requests the opening of a socket.
- The parent opens the socket, associates it with the interface and transmits
  the socket to the child.
- The child sets up the filter.
- The child reads the packets directly from the socket!

The parent has much less to do: it no longer needs to configure the filter, it
no longer needs to read and transmit network packets. Similarly, it will only
need to open the log file, it will no longer need to write to it. That's less
code in the parent and fewer interactions to manage. This will simplify our code
and reduce the risk of having a bug in the part that runs as root.

In practice, how do we send and receive a file descriptor in a Unix socket? The
solution is explained in the [`unix(7)`][unix] manual page: via the
[`sendmsg()`][sendmsg] and [`recvmsg()`][recvmsg] calls, it is possible to
transmit a file descriptor or the user's identity (reliably, it's the operating
system that guarantees this transmission). The [`cmsg(3)`][cmsg] manual page
contains an example of sending a set of file descriptors.

To find a complete example, I advise you to look at the specialists in privilege
separation. As an example, we can examine the source code of `syslogd` and
discover a [file grouping the two functions we need][FDPASS].

Here's a lightweight version that doesn't handle errors. For real projects, of
course, you should use the complete version!

    send_fd(int sock, int fd)
    {
        struct msghdr msg;
        union {

        struct iovec vec;
        int result;
        int fd;

        memset(&msg, 0, sizeof(msg));
        vec.iov_base = &result;
        vec.iov_len = sizeof(int);
        msg.msg_iov = &vec;
        msg.msg_iovlen = 1;
        msg.msg_control = &cmsgbuf.buf;
        msg.msg_controllen = sizeof(cmsgbuf.buf);
        recvmsg(sock, &msg, 0);
        cmsg = CMSG_FIRSTHDR(&msg);
        assert(cmsg->cmsg_type == SCM_RIGHTS);
        fd = (*(int *)CMSG_DATA(cmsg));
        return fd;
    }

## Second attempt

With this new knowledge, we can now rewrite our sniffer using the ability to
pass file descriptors through the socket.

We must first agree on a very simple protocol to communicate between the parent
and the child. The parent only needs to know how to do two things: open a socket
and open the log file. The protocol is then very simple: the child sends the
command to execute on an integer, followed by the name of the interface in the
case of opening the socket, and it receives in return the file descriptor (the
socket or that of the log file). Here is the code that will replace the calls to
`socket()` and `bind()` as well as the one to `fopen()`:

    ::c
    int
    priv_socket(char *name)
    {
        int cmd;
        char ifname[IFNAMSIZ];

        strncpy(ifname, name, IFNAMSIZ);
        cmd = PRIV_SOCKET;
        must_write(remote, &cmd, sizeof(int));
        must_write(remote, ifname, IFNAMSIZ);
        return receive_fd(remote);
    }

    FILE *
    priv_fopen()
    {
        int cmd, fd;

        cmd = PRIV_LOGFILE;
        must_write(remote, &cmd, sizeof(int));
        fd = receive_fd(remote);
        if (fd == -1)
            return NULL;
        return fdopen(fd, "a");
    }

Let's note an important point concerning security. The [`fdopen()`][fdopen] call
cannot reopen the file with a different mode, for example `"w"`. Indeed,
`fdopen()` integrates the information from the file descriptor into a structure
that other calls will subsequently manipulate. It will also check the
consistency between the requested mode and the one associated with the file
descriptor using [`fcntl()`][fcntl]. If we attempt to expand permissions, this
call will fail. This verification has no impact on the security of the process.

On the parent side, we first receive an integer (there is respect for message
boundaries, it's easy), then, depending on its value, we perform the requested
actions and send back the file descriptor:

    ::c
    void
    priv_loop()
    {
        int cmd;
        char ifname[IFNAMSIZ];
        int s;
        struct sockaddr_ll sa;
        int alreadyopen = 0;

        while (!may_read(remote, &cmd, sizeof(int))) {
            switch (cmd) {
            case PRIV_SOCKET:
                if (alreadyopen)
                    exit(1);
                must_read(remote, ifname, IFNAMSIZ);
                ifname[IFNAMSIZ-1] = '\0';
                if ((s = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW,
                                htons(ETH_P_ALL))) < 0) {
                    fprintf(stderr, "unable to open raw socket (%m)\n");
                    exit(1);
                }

                memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
                sa.sll_family = AF_PACKET;
                sa.sll_protocol = 0;
                ifname[IFNAMSIZ-1] = '\0';
                if ((sa.sll_ifindex = if_nametoindex(ifname)) == 0) {
                    fprintf(stderr, "unknown interface %s\n", ifname);
                    exit(1);
                }

                if (bind(s, (struct sockaddr*)&sa, sizeof(sa)) < 0) {
                    fprintf(stderr, "unable to listen to %s (%m)\n", ifname);
                    exit(1);
                }

                alreadyopen = 1;
                send_fd(remote, s);
                close(s);
                break;

            case PRIV_LOGFILE:
                if ((s = open(LOG, O_WRONLY | O_APPEND | O_CREAT, 0600)) < 0) {
                    fprintf(stderr, "unable to open %s (%m)\n", LOG);
                    exit(1);
                }
                send_fd(remote, s);
                close(s);
                break;

            default:
                fprintf(stderr, "unknown command\n");
                exit(1);
            }
        }
    }

The functions `must_write()`, `must_read()`, and `may_read()` are wrappers
around `write()` and `read()` that we do not reproduce here due to lack of
space. You can retrieve them from the [`syslogd` source code][SYSLOGD].

Finally, we replace the call to `socket()` with a call to `priv_socket()` and
remove the call to `bind()`. We replace the call to `fopen()` with a call to
`priv_fopen()`.

There are a few minor details to sort out. If the parent or child dies
(voluntarily or not), the remaining process must also die. It's sufficient to
set up a few functions reacting to signals and to use [`atexit()`][atexit] in
the parent to kill the child in case of the parent's death. This also allows the
user to stop the sniffer by killing either the parent or the child.

We then obtain an application functionally identical to our version without
privilege separation, but running in two processes communicating with each
other:

    root     12174 S+   19:25   0:00 ./sniffer4 wifi
    nobody   12175 S+   19:25   0:00 ./sniffer4 wifi

If an attacker takes control of the child, they will only be able to write to
the end of the log file and listen on the network interface. They will
unfortunately also be able to send arbitrary packets on this interface.

Note that it is unlikely that they can listen on another network interface, as
the child can only request to listen on a single network interface. This is the
purpose of our `alreadyopen` variable. This is an important component of
privilege separation: managing a state at the parent level so as not to allow
the child to execute certain commands multiple times. This makes the attacker's
task more difficult.

The code to be seriously audited is now confined to the `priv_loop()` function,
as well as its dependencies. Bugs found outside this perimeter do not, a priori,
allow immediate root access. Any parsing errors are still there, but no longer
provide the attacker with as much power. Despite the possibility for the
attacker to send arbitrary packets on the interface we're listening to, this
latest version of the sniffer seems to constitute a good balance between the
possibilities offered to an attacker who has compromised the unprivileged
process and the quantity and complexity of the code running with elevated
privileges.

# The alternatives

Adding privilege separation is not fundamentally very complicated. It requires
correctly writing a certain number of lines of code and agreeing on an adequate
protocol between the parent and the child, particularly with regard to possible
error reporting. In our simplistic example, we stop the sniffer if the file we
want to log to is in a directory that doesn't exist. It is sometimes desirable
to be cleaner and to report this kind of error from the parent to the child.

To overcome these difficulties, there are two avenues to explore.

## privman

[privman][PRIVMAN] is a library facilitating the addition of privilege
separation in an application. It is indeed sufficient to call a function at the
beginning of the program to create the monitor (the parent), then to replace the
functions requiring particular privileges with the provided wrappers. These
respect the same interface as the functions they replace.

The example provided on the website is a good illustration of the ease provided
by such a library.

    ::c
    #include <privman.h>
    int main()
    {
        priv_init();
        int fd = priv_open("/etc/shadow", O_RDONLY);
        return 0;
    }

You then need to fill out a configuration file to indicate the operations
authorized by the monitor. As mentioned earlier, it is essential that it does
not turn into a simple proxy. The configuration file indicates, for example, the
files that can be opened in read-only mode.

Unfortunately, this library no longer seems to be maintained. I also don't know
if it has been audited.

## imsg

The OpenBSD project uses privilege separation very heavily. As such, the
developers have developed a set of methods to facilitate communication between
processes, including the passing of file descriptors. New developments no longer
use the functions borrowed in our example.

Let's take for example the [`relayd`][RELAYD] daemon which is a load balancer.
The file to look at is [`imsg.h`][imsg]. There we find a set of functions that
can be used instead of the functions from [`syslogd`][SYSLOGD].

These methods implement a protocol on top of Unix sockets and allow for easier
management of communication between the parent and the child: we send sets of
bytes, some of which can be associated with a file descriptor, and we receive
sets of bytes, possibly associated with file descriptors. It is therefore
possible, in a single message exchange, to obtain all the necessary information
while managing error cases that may occur.

!!! "Update (2023-02)" The article "[Privilege drop, privilege separation, and
restricted-service operating mode in OpenBSD][sha256]" is a good read on
privilege separation in OpenBSD.

# Conclusion

While privilege separation is the norm for the OpenBSD project, it is still very
often the exception in many other universes. Take your favorite GNU/Linux
distribution, look at the list of processes running as root and find those that
use privilege separation. For my part, I only spot OpenSSH (and possibly
Postfix, even if it's not at all the same method).

Privilege separation is, however, a considerable asset in securing an
application. Let's hope it will be more and more used.
