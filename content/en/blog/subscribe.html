The easiest way to be notified when new articles are published on this
blog is to [subscribe to the RSS feed <i
class="lf-sprite-rss"></i>][rss]. If you don't already have an RSS
reader, many applications exist for this purpose, including
[Miniflux][] and [NewsBlur][]. Some services, like [Blogtrottr][] or
[FeedRabbit][], enable you to receive RSS feeds through email.

Alternatively, you can follow me on [Twitter][].
