   Instead of using a query builder to let a user filter flows,
   Akvorado uses a SQL-like language and a code editor with
   syntax highlighting and completion.

[Akvorado][] collects network flows using [IPFIX][] or [sFlow][]. It stores them
in a [ClickHouse][] database. A web console allows a user to query the data and
plot some graphs. A nice aspect of this console is how we can filter flows with
a SQL-like language:

![Example of filter being typed by a user with completion enabled]([[!!images/akvorado-filter.mp4]]
"Filter editor in Akvorado console")

<!--
InIfBoundary = external AND 
ExporterRegion = "france" AND 
InIfConnectivity = "transit" AND 
SrcAS = AS15169 AND 
DstAddr << 2a01:e0f:ffff::/48
-->

Often, web interfaces expose a [query][vue-query-builder]
[builder][react-query-builder] to build such filters. I think combining a
SQL-like language with an editor supporting **completion**, **syntax
highlighting**, and **linting** is a better approach.[^lazy]

[^lazy]: Moreover, building a query builder did not seem like a fun task for me.

The language parser is built with [pigeon][] (_Go_) from a [parsing expression
grammar][]—or PEG. The editor component is [CodeMirror][] (*TypeScript*).

# Language parser

PEG grammars are relatively recent[^recent] and are an alternative to
context-free grammars. They are easier to write and they can generate better
error messages. Python [switched from an LL(1)-based parser to a PEG-based
parser][pep617] in Python 3.9.

[^recent]: They were introduced in 2004 in “[Parsing Expression Grammars: A
    Recognition-Based Syntactic Foundation][peg2004].” LR parsers were
    introduced in [1965][knuth1965], LALR parsers in 1969, and LL parsers in the
    1970s. [Yacc][], a popular parser generator, was written in 1975.

[pigeon][] generates a parser for Go. A grammar is a set of rules. Each rule is
an identifier, with an optional user-friendly label for error messages, an
expression, and an action in Go to be executed on match. You can find the
complete grammar in [`parser.peg`][parser.peg]. Here is a simplified rule:

```pigeon
ConditionIPExpr "condition on IP" ←
  column:("ExporterAddress"i { return "ExporterAddress", nil }
        / "SrcAddr"i { return "SrcAddr", nil }
        / "DstAddr"i { return "DstAddr", nil }) _ 
  operator:("=" / "!=") _ 
  ip:IP {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s %s IPv6StringToNum(%s)",
      toString(column), toString(operator), quote(ip)), nil
  }
```

The rule identifier is `ConditionIPExpr`. It case-insensitively matches
`ExporterAddress`, `SrcAddr`, or `DstAddr`. The action for each case returns the
proper case for the column name. That's what is stored in the `column` variable.
Then, it matches one of the possible operators. As there is no code block, it
stores the matched string directly in the `operator` variable. Then, it tries to
match the `IP` rule, which is defined elsewhere in the grammar. If it succeeds,
it stores the result of the match in the `ip` variable and executes the final
action. The action turns the column, operator, and IP into a proper expression
for *ClickHouse*. For example, if we have `ExporterAddress = 203.0.113.15`, we
get `ExporterAddress = IPv6StringToNum('203.0.113.15')`.

The `IP` rule uses a rudimentary regular expression but checks if the matched
address is correct in the action block, thanks to `netip.ParseAddr()`:

```pigeon
IP "IP address" ← [0-9A-Fa-f:.]+ {
  ip, err := netip.ParseAddr(string(c.text))
  if err != nil {
    return "", errors.New("expecting an IP address")
  }
  return ip.String(), nil
}
```

Our parser safely turns the filter into a `WHERE` clause accepted by
*ClickHouse*:[^ast]

```sql
WHERE InIfBoundary = 'external' 
AND ExporterRegion = 'france' 
AND InIfConnectivity = 'transit' 
AND SrcAS = 15169 
AND DstAddr BETWEEN toIPv6('2a01:e0f:ffff::') 
                AND toIPv6('2a01:e0f:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff')
```

[^ast]: The parser returns a string. It does not generate an intermediate AST.
    This makes it simpler and it currently fits our needs.

# Integration in CodeMirror

[CodeMirror][] is a versatile code editor that can be easily integrated into
JavaScript projects. In *Akvorado*, the [Vue.js][] component,
[`InputFilter`][inputfilter.vue], uses _CodeMirror_ as its foundation and
leverages features such as syntax highlighting, linting, and completion. The
source code for these capabilities can be found in the
[`codemirror/lang-filter/`][lang-filter] directory.

## Syntax highlighting

The PEG grammar for Go cannot be utilized directly[^pegjs] and the requirements
for parsers for editors are distinct: they should be error-tolerant and operate
incrementally, as code is typically updated character by character. _CodeMirror_
offers a solution through its own parser generator, [Lezer][].

We don't need this additional parser to fully understand the filter language.
Only the basic structure is needed: column names, comparison and logic
operators, quoted and unquoted values. The [grammar][] is therefore quite short
and does not need to be updated often:

```lezer
@top Filter {
  expression
}

expression {
 Not expression |
 "(" expression ")" |
 "(" expression ")" And expression |
 "(" expression ")" Or expression |
 comparisonExpression And expression |
 comparisonExpression Or expression |
 comparisonExpression
}
comparisonExpression {
 Column Operator Value
}

Value {
  String | Literal | ValueLParen ListOfValues ValueRParen
}
ListOfValues {
  ListOfValues ValueComma (String | Literal) |
  String | Literal
}

// […]
@tokens {
  // […]
  Column { std.asciiLetter (std.asciiLetter|std.digit)* }
  Operator { $[a-zA-Z!=><]+ }

  String {
    '"' (![\\\n"] | "\\" _)* '"'? |
    "'" (![\\\n'] | "\\" _)* "'"?
  }
  Literal { (std.digit | std.asciiLetter | $[.:/])+ }
  // […]
}
```

The expression `SrcAS = 12322 AND (DstAS = 1299 OR SrcAS = 29447)` is parsed to:

```text
Filter(Column, Operator, Value(Literal),
  And, Column, Operator, Value(Literal),
  Or, Column, Operator, Value(Literal))
```

The last step is to teach *CodeMirror* how to map each token to a highlighting
tag:

```ts
export const FilterLanguage = LRLanguage.define({
  parser: parser.configure({
    props: [
      styleTags({
        Column: t.propertyName,
        String: t.string,
        Literal: t.literal,
        LineComment: t.lineComment,
        BlockComment: t.blockComment,
        Or: t.logicOperator,
        And: t.logicOperator,
        Not: t.logicOperator,
        Operator: t.compareOperator,
        "( )": t.paren,
      }),
    ],
  }),
});
```

[^pegjs]: It could be manually translated to JavaScript with [PEG.js][].

## Linting

We offload linting to the original parser in Go. The
`/api/v0/console/filter/validate` endpoint accepts a filter and returns a JSON
structure with the errors that were found:

```json
{
  "message": "at line 1, position 12: string literal not terminated",
  "errors": [{
    "line":    1,
    "column":  12,
    "offset":  11,
    "message": "string literal not terminated",
  }]
}
```

The [linter source][] for *CodeMirror* queries the API and turns each error into
a [diagnostic][].

## Completion

The completion system takes a hybrid approach. It splits the work between the
frontend and the backend to offer useful suggestions for completing filters.

The [frontend][] uses the parser built with *Lezer* to determine the context of
the completion: do we complete a column name, an operator, or a value? It also
extracts the column name if we are completing something else. It forwards the
result to the backend through the `/api/v0/console/filter/complete` endpoint.
Walking the syntax tree was not as easy as I thought, but [unit tests][] helped
a lot.

The [backend][] uses the parser generated by *pigeon* to complete a column name
or a comparison operator. For values, the completions are either static or
extracted from the *ClickHouse* database. A user can complete an AS number from
an organization name thanks to the following snippet:

```go
results := []struct {
  Label  string `ch:"label"`
  Detail string `ch:"detail"`
}{}
columnName := "DstAS"
sqlQuery := fmt.Sprintf(`
 SELECT concat('AS', toString(%s)) AS label, dictGet('asns', 'name', %s) AS detail
 FROM flows
 WHERE TimeReceived > date_sub(minute, 1, now())
 AND detail != ''
 AND positionCaseInsensitive(detail, $1) >= 1
 GROUP BY label, detail
 ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
 LIMIT 20
`, columnName, columnName)
if err := conn.Select(ctx, &results, sqlQuery, input.Prefix); err != nil {
  c.r.Err(err).Msg("unable to query database")
  break
}
for _, result := range results {
  completions = append(completions, filterCompletion{
    Label:  result.Label,
    Detail: result.Detail,
    Quoted: false,
  })
}
```

In my opinion, the completion system is a major factor in making the field
editor an efficient way to select flows. While a query builder may have been
more beginner-friendly, the completion system's ease of use and functionality
make it more enjoyable to use once you become familiar.
