!!! "Update (2019-05)" Have a look at the [2019
edition]([[en/blog/2019-pragmatic-debian-packaging.html]]) of this
guide if you target only recent distributions (Debian Stretch and
Ubuntu Bionic).

While the creation of Debian packages is [abundantly][newmaint]
[documented][newmaint], most [tutorials][tutorial] are targeted to
packages implementing the [Debian policy][policy]. Moreover, Debian
packaging has **a reputation of being unnecessarily
difficult**[^difficulty] and many people prefer to use less
constrained tools[^fpm] like [fpm][] or [CheckInstall][].

[^difficulty]: People may remember the time before *debhelper* 7.0.50
               (circa 2009) where `debian/rules` was a daunting
               beast. However, nowaday, the boilerplate is quite
               reduced.

[^fpm]: The complexity is not the only reason. These alternative tools
        enable the creation of RPM packages, something that Debian
        tools don't.

However, building Debian packages with the official tools can become
straightforward if you bend some rules:

 1. **No source package will be generated**.  Packages will be built
    directly from a checkout of a VCS repository.

 2. **Additional dependencies can be downloaded during
    build**. Packaging individually each dependency is a painstaking
    work, notably when you have to deal with some fast-paced
    ecosystems like Java, JavaScript and Go.

 3. The produced packages may **bundle dependencies**. This is likely
    to raise some concerns about security and long-term maintenance,
    but this is a common trade-off in many ecosystems, notably Java,
    JavaScript and Go.

# Pragmatic packages 101

In the Debian archive, you have two kinds of packages: the **source
packages** and the **binary packages**. Each binary package is built
from a source package. You need a name for each package.

As stated in the introduction, we won't generate a source package but
we will work with its unpacked form which is any source tree
containing a `debian/` directory. In our examples, we will start with
a source tree containing only a `debian/` directory but you are free
to include this `debian/` directory into an existing project.

As an example, we will package [memcached][], a distributed memory
cache. There are four files to create:

 - `debian/compat`;
 - `debian/changelog`;
 - `debian/control`; and
 - `debian/rules`.

The first one is easy. Put `9` in it:[^compat]

    ::sh
    echo 9 > debian/compat

[^compat]: This compatibility level is available from Debian 8 and
    Ubuntu Precise. Therefore, this covers a wide range of
    distributions.

The second one has the following content:

    memcached (0.0-0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

      * Fake entry

     -- Happy Packager <happy@example.com>  Tue, 19 Apr 2016 22:27:05 +0200

The only important information is the name of the source package,
`memcached`, on the first line. Everything else can be left as is as
it won't influence the generated binary packages.

## The control file

`debian/control` describes the metadata of both the source package and
the generated binary packages. We have to write a block for each of
them.

    ::control
    Source: memcached
    Maintainer: Vincent Bernat <bernat@debian.org>

    Package: memcached
    Architecture: any
    Description: high-performance memory object caching system

The source package is called `memcached`. We have to use the same name
as in `debian/changelog`.

We generate only one binary package: `memcached`. In the remaining of
the example, when you see `memcached`, this is the name of a binary
package. The `Architecture` field should be set to either `any` or
`all`. Use `all` exclusively if the package contains only
arch-independent files. In doubt, just stick to `any`.

The `Description` field contains a short description of the binary
package.

## The build recipe

The last mandatory file is `debian/rules`. It's the **recipe** of the
package. We need to retrieve *memcached*, build it and install its
file tree in `debian/memcached/`. It looks like this:

    ::make
    #!/usr/bin/make -f

    DISTRIBUTION = $(shell lsb_release -sr)
    VERSION = 1.4.25
    PACKAGEVERSION = $(VERSION)-0~$(DISTRIBUTION)0
    TARBALL = memcached-$(VERSION).tar.gz
    URL = http://www.memcached.org/files/$(TARBALL)

    %:
    	dh $@

    override_dh_auto_clean:
    override_dh_auto_test:
    override_dh_auto_build:
    override_dh_auto_install:
    	wget -N --progress=dot:mega $(URL)
    	tar --strip-components=1 -xf $(TARBALL)
    	./configure --prefix=/usr
    	make
    	make install DESTDIR=debian/memcached

    override_dh_gencontrol:
    	dh_gencontrol -- -v$(PACKAGEVERSION)


The empty targets `override_dh_auto_clean`, `override_dh_auto_test`
and `override_dh_auto_build` keep *debhelper* from being too
smart. The `override_dh_gencontrol` target sets the package
version[^version] without updating `debian/changelog`. If you ignore
the slight boilerplate, the recipe is quite similar to what you would
have done with `fpm`:

    ::sh
    DISTRIBUTION=$(lsb_release -sr)
    VERSION=1.4.25
    PACKAGEVERSION=${VERSION}-0~${DISTRIBUTION}0
    TARBALL=memcached-${VERSION}.tar.gz
    URL=http://www.memcached.org/files/${TARBALL}

    wget -N --progress=dot:mega ${URL}
    tar --strip-components=1 -xf ${TARBALL}
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    make install DESTDIR=/tmp/installdir

    # Build the final package
    fpm -s dir -t deb \
        -n memcached \
        -v ${PACKAGEVERSION} \
        -C /tmp/installdir \
        --description "high-performance memory object caching system"

[^version]: There are many ways to version a package. Again, if you
            want to be pragmatic, the proposed solution should be good
            enough for Ubuntu. On Debian, it doesn't cover upgrade
            from one distribution version to another, but we assume
            that nowadays, systems get reinstalled instead of being
            upgraded.

You can review the whole package tree on [GitHub][memcached-basic-gh]
and build it with `dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b`.

# Pragmatic packages 102

At this point, we can iterate and add several improvements to our
*memcached* package. **None of them are mandatory** but they are
usually worth the additional effort.

## Build dependencies

Our initial build recipe only works when several packages are
installed, like `wget` and `libevent-dev`. They are not present on all
Debian systems. You can easily express that you need them by adding a
`Build-Depends` section for the source package in `debian/control`:

    ::control
    Source: memcached
    Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 9),
                   wget, ca-certificates, lsb-release,
                   libevent-dev

Always specify the `debhelper (>= 9)` dependency as we heavily rely on
it. We don't require `make` or a C compiler because it is assumed that
the `build-essential` meta-package is installed and it pulls
them. `dpkg-buildpackage` will complain if the dependencies are not
met. If you want to install these packages from your CI system, you
can use the following command:[^devscripts]

    ::sh
    mk-build-deps \
        -t 'apt-get -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes --no-install-recommends -qqy' \
        -i -r debian/control

[^devscripts]: You also need to install `devscripts` and `equivs` package.

You may also want to investigate [pbuilder][] or [sbuild][], two tools
to build Debian packages in a clean isolated environment.

## Runtime dependencies

If the resulting package is installed on a freshly installed machine,
it won't work because it will be missing *libevent*, a required
library for *memcached*. You can express the dependencies needed by
each binary package by adding a `Depends` field. Moreover, for dynamic
libraries, you can automatically get the right dependencies by using
some substitution variables:

    ::control
    Package: memcached
    Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}

The resulting package will contain the following information:

    ::console
    $ dpkg -I ../memcached_1.4.25-0\~unstable0_amd64.deb | grep Depends
     Depends: libc6 (>= 2.17), libevent-2.0-5 (>= 2.0.10-stable)

## Integration with init system

Most packaged daemons come with some integration with the init
system. This integration ensures the daemon will be started on boot
and restarted on upgrade. For Debian-based distributions, there are
several init systems available. The most prominent ones are:

 - **System-V init** is the historical init system. More modern
   inits are able to reuse scripts written for this init, so this is a
   safe common denominator for packaged daemons.
 - **Upstart** is the less-historical init system for Ubuntu (used in
   Ubuntu 14.10 and previous releases).
 - **systemd** is the default init system for Debian since Jessie and
   for Ubuntu since 15.04.

Writing a correct script for the *System-V init* is
error-prone. Therefore, I usually prefer to provide a native
configuration file for the default init system of the targeted
distribution (*Upstart* and *systemd*).

### System-V

If you want to provide a *System-V* init script, have a look at
`/etc/init.d/skeleton` on the most ancient distribution you want to
target and adapt it.[^provided] Put the result in
`debian/memcached.init`. It will be installed at the right place,
invoked on install, upgrade and removal. On Debian-based systems, many
init scripts allow user customizations by providing a
`/etc/default/memcached` file. You can ship one by putting its content
in `debian/memcached.default`.

[^provided]: It's also possible to use a script provided by
             upstream. However, there is no such thing as an init
             script that works on all distributions. Compare the
             proposed with the skeleton, check if it is using
             `start-stop-daemon` and if it sources
             `/lib/lsb/init-functions` before considering it. If it
             seems to fit, you can install it yourself in
             `debian/memcached/etc/init.d/`. *debhelper* will ensure
             its proper integration.

### Upstart

Providing an *Upstart* job is similar: put it in
`debian/memcached.upstart`. For example:

    description "memcached daemon"

    start on runlevel [2345]
    stop on runlevel [!2345]
    respawn
    respawn limit 5 60
    expect daemon

    script
      . /etc/default/memcached
      exec memcached -d -u $USER -p $PORT -m $CACHESIZE -c $MAXCONN $OPTIONS
    end script

When writing an *Upstart* job, the most important directive is
[expect][]. Be sure to get it right. Here, we use `expect daemon` and
*memcached* is started with the `-d` flag.

### systemd

Providing a *systemd* unit is a bit more complex. The content of the
file should go in `debian/memcached.service`. For example:

    ::systemd
    [Unit]
    Description=memcached daemon
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=forking
    EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/memcached
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/memcached -d -u $USER -p $PORT -m $CACHESIZE -c $MAXCONN $OPTIONS
    Restart=on-failure

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

We reuse `/etc/default/memcached` even if it is not considered a good
practice with systemd.[^default] Like for *Upstart*, the directive
`Type` is quite important. We used `forking` as *memcached* is started
with the `-d` flag.

[^default]: Instead, a user wanting to customize the options is
            expected to edit the unit with `systemctl edit`.

!!! "Update (2017-11)" When targeting Debian Stretch, Ubuntu Yaketty
or more recent, put `10` in `debian/compat` and ignore the following
instructions.

You also need to add a build-dependency to `dh-systemd` in
`debian/control`:

    ::control
    Source: memcached
    Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 9),
                   wget, ca-certificates, lsb-release,
                   libevent-dev,
                   dh-systemd

And you need to modify the default rule in `debian/rules`:

    ::make
    %:
    	dh $@ --with systemd

The extra complexity is a bit unfortunate but *systemd* integration
was not part of *debhelper*.[^bug822670] Without these additional
modifications, the unit will get installed but you won't get a proper
integration and the service won't be enabled on install or boot.

[^bug822670]: See [#822670](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive=yes&bug=822670).

## Dedicated user

Many daemons don't need to run as *root* and it is a good practice to
ship a dedicated user. In the case of *memcached*, we can provide a
`_memcached` user.[^naming]

!!! "Update (2018-11)" If you only care about *systemd*, you may save
time and energy by using its [dynamic users feature][] instead.

[^naming]: The Debian Policy doesn't provide any hint for the naming
           convention of these system users. A common usage is to
           prefix the daemon name with an underscore (like
           `_memcached`). Another common usage is to use `Debian-` as
           a prefix. The main drawback of the latter solution is that
           the name is likely to be replaced by the UID in `ps` and
           `top` because of its length.

Add a `debian/memcached.postinst` file with the following content:

    ::shell
    #!/bin/sh

    set -e

    case "$1" in
        configure)
            adduser --system --disabled-password --disabled-login --home /var/empty \
                    --no-create-home --quiet --force-badname --group _memcached
            ;;
    esac

    #DEBHELPER#

    exit 0

There is no cleanup of the user when the package is removed for two reasons:

 1. Less stuff to write.
 2. The user could still own some files.

The utility `adduser` will do the right thing whatever the requested
user already exists or not. You need to add it as a dependency in
`debian/control`:

    ::control
    Package: memcached
    Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, adduser

The `#DEBHELPER#` marker is important as it will be replaced by some
code to handle the service configuration files (or some other stuff).

You can review the whole package tree on
[GitHub][memcached-intermediate-gh] and build it with
`dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b`.

# Pragmatic packages 103

It is possible to leverage *debhelper* to **reduce the recipe size**
and to make it **more declarative**. This section is quite optional
and it requires understanding a bit more how a Debian package is
built. Feel free to skip it.

## The big picture

There are **four steps** to build a regular Debian package:

 1. `debian/rules clean` should **clean** the source tree to make it
    pristine.

 2. `debian/rules build` should trigger the **build**. For an
    autoconf-based software, like *memcached*, this step should
    execute something like `./configure && make`.

 3. `debian/rules install` should **install** the file tree of each
    binary package. For an autoconf-based software, this step should
    execute `make install DESTDIR=debian/memcached`.

 4. `debian/rules binary` will **pack** the different file trees into
    binary packages.

You don't directly write each of these targets. Instead, you let `dh`,
a component of *debhelper*, do most of the work. The following
`debian/rules` file should do almost everything correctly with many
source packages:

    ::make
    #!/usr/bin/make -f
    %:
    	dh $@

For each of the four targets described above, you can run `dh`
with `--no-act` to see what it would do. For example:

    ::console
    $ dh build --no-act
       dh_testdir
       dh_update_autotools_config
       dh_auto_configure
       dh_auto_build
       dh_auto_test

Each of these helpers has a manual page. Helpers starting with
`dh_auto_` are a bit "magic." For example, `dh_auto_configure` will
try to automatically configure a package prior to building: it will
detect the build system and invoke `./configure`, `cmake` or
`Makefile.PL`.

If one of the helpers do not do the "right" thing, you can replace it
by using an override target:

    ::make
    override_dh_auto_configure:
    	./configure --with-some-grog

These helpers are also configurable, so you can just alter a bit their
behavior by invoking them with additional options:

    ::make
    override_dh_auto_configure:
    	dh_auto_configure -- --with-some-grog

This way, `./configure` will be called with your custom flag but also
with a lot of default flags like `--prefix=/usr` for better
integration.

In the initial *memcached* example, we overrode all these "magic"
targets. `dh_auto_clean`, `dh_auto_configure` and `dh_auto_build` are
converted to no-ops to avoid any unexpected
behavior. `dh_auto_install` is hijacked to do all the build
process. Additionally, we modified the behavior of the `dh_gencontrol`
helper by forcing the version number instead of using the one from
`debian/changelog`.

## Automatic builds

As *memcached* is an autoconf-enabled package, **`dh` knows how
to build it**: `./configure && make && make install`. Therefore, we
can let it handle most of the work with this `debian/rules` file:

    ::make
    #!/usr/bin/make -f

    DISTRIBUTION = $(shell lsb_release -sr)
    VERSION = 1.4.25
    PACKAGEVERSION = $(VERSION)-0~$(DISTRIBUTION)0
    TARBALL = memcached-$(VERSION).tar.gz
    URL = http://www.memcached.org/files/$(TARBALL)

    %:
    	dh $@ --with systemd

    override_dh_auto_clean:
    	wget -N --progress=dot:mega $(URL)
    	tar --strip-components=1 -xf $(TARBALL)

    override_dh_auto_test:
    	# Don't run the whitespace test
    	rm t/whitespace.t
    	dh_auto_test

    override_dh_gencontrol:
    	dh_gencontrol -- -v$(PACKAGEVERSION)

The `dh_auto_clean` target is hijacked to download and setup the
source tree.[^clean] We don't override the `dh_auto_configure` step,
so `dh` will execute the `./configure` script with the appropriate
options. We don't override the `dh_auto_build` step either: `dh` will
execute `make`. `dh_auto_test` is invoked after the build and it will
run the *memcached* test suite. We need to override it because one of
the test is complaining about odd whitespaces in the `debian/`
directory. We suppress this rogue test and let `dh_auto_test` executes
the test suite. `dh_auto_install` is not overridden either, so `dh`
will execute some variant of `make install`.

[^clean]: We could call `dh_auto_clean` at the end of the target to
          let it invoke `make clean`. However, it is assumed that a
          fresh checkout is used before each build.

To get a better sense of the difference, here is a diff:

    ::diff

    +
    +override_dh_auto_test:
    +	# Don't run the whitespace test
    +	rm t/whitespace.t
    +	dh_auto_test

It is up to you to decide if `dh` can do some work for you, but
you could try to start from a minimal `debian/rules` and only override
some targets.

## Install additional files

While `make install` installed the essential files for *memcached*,
you may want to **put additional files** in the binary package. You
could use `cp` in your build recipe, but you can also declare them:

 - files listed in `debian/memcached.docs` will be copied to
   `/usr/share/doc/memcached` by `dh_installdocs`
 - files listed in `debian/memcached.examples` will be copied to
   `/usr/share/doc/memcached/examples` by `dh_installexamples`
 - files listed in `debian/memcached.manpages` will be copied to the
   appropriate subdirectory of `/usr/share/man` by `dh_installman`

Here is an example using wildcards for `debian/memcached.docs`:

    doc/*.txt

If you need to copy some files to an arbitrary location, you can list
them along with their destination directories in
`debian/memcached.install` and `dh_install` will take care of the
copy. Here is an example:

    scripts/memcached-tool usr/bin

Using these files make the build process **more declarative**. It is a
matter of taste and you are free to use `cp` in `debian/rules`
instead. You can review the whole package tree on
[GitHub][memcached-gh].

# Other examples

The [Git repository][GitHub] contains some additional
examples. They all follow the same scheme:

 - `dh_auto_clean` is hijacked to download and setup the source tree
 - `dh_gencontrol` is modified to use a computed version

Notably, you'll find daemons in [Java][], [Go][], [Python][] and
[Node.js][]. The goal of these examples is to demonstrate that using
Debian tools to build Debian packages can be straightforward. Hope
this helps.
