The goal of this lab is to setup a site-to-site IPsec VPN. This lab is
similar to my [first lab using UML][umllab]. The major differences
are:

 - We only setup one VPN instead of two.
 - Static routing is used in place of BGP for inter-site
   routing. Moreover, [BIRD][bird] is used as a routing daemon.
 - VPN are using an external network for Internet access.
 - Both internal network and external network are redundant using one
   OSPF instance each.

# The lab

![VPN lab][1]

## The big picture

The main point of this architecture is that you get two redundant
networks for each site. The external ones are used when hosts need
Internet access. The internal ones are used when they want to
communicate with each other. Because we don't want hosts from the
first site to communicate with hosts from the second site through the
external network, we extend the internal network with the help of a
site-to-site IPsec VPN.

Each set of networks is using two layer-3 networks on top of two
layer-2 networks. OSPF is used to provide redundancy and
aggregation. For example, `R1` has two routes through `V1` to access
`R2` which is on the other site:

    ::console
    # ip route show 192.168.96.0/19
    192.168.96.0/19  proto zebra  metric 10000 
            nexthop via 192.168.1.100  dev eth0 weight 1
            nexthop via 192.168.2.100  dev eth1 weight 1

## Setting up the lab

First, grab the source of the lab:

    ::console
    $ git clone https://vincentbernat@github.com/vincentbernat/network-lab.git
    $ cd network-lab/lab-s2s-vpn

You may try to run `./setup` directly. It may be safer to build an
image of Debian inside inside a directory and use it as a base for the
lab.

    ::console
    $ sudo debootstrap sid ../sid-chroot http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/
    [...]
    $ sudo chroot ../sid-chroot /bin/bash
    # apt-get install iproute zsh rsyslog less makedev tcpdump
    # apt-get install bird quagga racoon
    # exit
    $ ROOT=../sid-chroot ./setup

You still need a working UML kernel. On Ubuntu, the one provided in
`user-mode-linux` does [not contain the `aufs.ko` module][LP801445]. I
did not find a simple workaround. You can just grab the
[package from Debian][umldebian] and install it on your Ubuntu with
`dpkg -i`.

## Use of BIRD

With the [previous lab][umllab], Quagga was used as an OSPF routing
daemon. We still use it on `R1`, `R2`, `E1` and `E2`. However, Quagga
is not able to run multiple instances of OSPF. [BIRD][bird]
can. Therefore, we use it on `V1` and `V2` because we need two OSPF
instances: one for the external network and one for the internal
network. Since we also need ECMP, we need at least BIRD 1.3.0.

BIRD allows the definition of multiple routing tables. Those tables
are independant of the kernel routing tables. Each protocol will
maintain its own set of routes and will allow us to export (or import)
routes from one of the routing table maintained by BIRD. In our setup,
we use four protocols and only one routing table (the default one).

![BIRD routing tables][2]
[2]: [[!!images/vpn-lab-bird.png]] "Route import/export between BIRD tables"

The `ospf EXTERNAL` protocol is one of the two OSPF instances we use on
`V1`. We import all the routes learned through the OSPF process into
the internal BIRD routing table. We don't export any route from the
BIRD routing table to this OSPF instance. Here is the configuration of
this protocol:

    protocol ospf EXTERNAL {
       ecmp yes;
       import all;
       export none;
       area 0.0.0.0 {
          networks {
             203.0.113.0/26;
             203.0.113.64/26;
             203.0.113.150/32;
          };
          interface "eth2";
          interface "eth3";
          interface "lo" {
            stub yes;
          };
       };
    }

`203.0.113.150/32` is defined on the loopback interface of `V1`. This
is the IP of the local VPN endpoint.

The `ospf INTERNAL` protocol is the second OSPF instance. We import all
routes from this protocol to the BIRD routing table. We also want to
advertise the route to the remote site. This route is defined in the
`static STATIC` protocol and imported into BIRD routing table.

    protocol static STATIC {
       import all;
       export none;
       route 192.168.96.0/19 via "lo";
    }

Therefore, `ospf INTERNAL` protocol export all routes originating from
the `static STATIC` protocol. This is done using filters:

    protocol ospf INTERNAL {
       ecmp yes;
       import all;
       export filter {
         if proto = "STATIC" then accept;
         reject;
       };
       area 0.0.0.0 {
          networks {
             192.168.1.0/24;
             192.168.2.0/24;
          };
          interface "eth0";
          interface "eth1";
       };
    }

The `kernel` protocol is managing one kernel routing table. By
default, it handles the `main` table. We don't import any route from the
kernel. However, we copy routes that come from other protocols, except
the static route because we already have a default route and the
static route is some kind of blackhole, we don't want to use it for
real routing.

    protocol kernel {
       persist;
       import none;
       export filter {
         if proto = "EXTERNAL" then accept;
         if proto = "INTERNAL" then accept;
         reject;
       };
    }

The filtering mechanism built inside BIRD is pretty powerful.

## Testing

After starting the lab, you need to wait a few seconds. You should
then be able to ping `R2` from `R1`:

    ::console
    R1# ping -c3 -I 192.168.15.1 192.168.115.1
    PING 192.168.115.1 (192.168.115.1) from 192.168.15.1 : 56(84) bytes of data.
    Warning: time of day goes back (-5435us), taking countermeasures.

    64 bytes from 192.168.115.1: icmp_req=2 ttl=62 time=0.569 ms

    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.569/0.729/0.921/0.147 ms

On `V1`, you can check BIRD internal routing table using `birdc`:

    ::console
    > show route 
    0.0.0.0/0          multipath [EXTERNAL 19:43] * E2 (150/10/1) [0.0.0.11]
            via 203.0.113.1 on eth2 weight 1
            via 203.0.113.65 on eth3 weight 1
    192.168.96.0/19    dev lo [STATIC 19:42] * (200)
    192.168.1.0/24     dev eth0 [INTERNAL 19:42] * I (150/10) [0.0.0.100]
    192.168.2.0/24     dev eth1 [INTERNAL 19:42] * I (150/10) [0.0.0.100]
    192.168.15.0/24    multipath [INTERNAL 19:43] * I (150/20) [0.0.0.10]
            via 192.168.1.10 on eth0 weight 1
            via 192.168.2.10 on eth1 weight 1
    203.0.113.0/26     dev eth2 [EXTERNAL 19:42] * I (150/10) [0.0.0.100]
    203.0.113.64/26    dev eth3 [EXTERNAL 19:42] * I (150/10) [0.0.0.100]
    203.0.113.150/32   dev lo [EXTERNAL 19:42] * I (150/0) [0.0.0.100]

The kernel routing table is similar except it does not contain the
static route.

# Adding more redundancy

The first goal of this lab was to test multiple OSPF instances and
ECMP with BIRD. It could be completed:

 - Adding a redundant VPN is easy: this is just a matter of duplicating the
   setup of the existing VPN.
 - Each router should be redundant by getting a sibling with the same
   configuration. In the case of `R1` and `R2`, a VIP could be shared
   between the router and its sibling with VRRP to allow hosts behind
   to have a single gateway and not use a routing protocol.
 - Because of the use of static routes instead of BGP, there is
   nothing to detect a VPN failure (which may be problematic if we
   setup a redundant VPN). Some VPN are able to invalidate a route
   when the associated VPN is down. This is not our case. Moreover,
   there may be some duplication in routing. This is not the case here
   because each site has its own internal network.
