In a [previous article][IPv6 route lookup on Linux], I explained how
Linux implements an IPv6 routing table. The following graph shows the
performance progression of route lookups through Linux history:

![IPv6 route lookup performance progression][i30]
[i30]: [[!!images/linux/ipv6-radix-perf.svg]] "IPv6 route lookup times for various Linux kernel versions. Lookup is done on a table with 40,000 routes. Notable performance changes are highlighted. The shaded surfaces represent the median absolute deviation."

All kernels are compiled with *GCC* 4.9 (from *Debian Jessie*). This version is
able to compile older kernels as well as current ones. The kernel configuration
is the default one with `CONFIG_SMP`, `CONFIG_IPV6`,
`CONFIG_IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES` and `CONFIG_IPV6_SUBTREES` options enabled. Some
other unrelated options are enabled to be able to boot them in a virtual machine
and run the benchmark.

There are three notable performance changes:

 - In Linux **3.1**, Eric Dumazet delays a bit the copy of route metrics to fix
   the undesirable sharing of route-specific metrics by all cache entries
   ([commit 21efcfa0ff27][]). Each cache entry now gets its own metrics, which
   explains the performance hit for the non-/128 scenarios.
 - In Linux **3.9**, Yoshifuji Hideaki removes the reference to the neighbor
   entry in `struct rt6_info` ([commit 887c95cc1da5][]). This should have lead to
   a performance increase. The small regression may be due to cache-related
   issues.
 - In Linux **4.2**, Martin KaFai Lau prevents the creation of cache entries for
   most route lookups. The most sensible performance improvement comes
   with [commit 4b32b5ad31a6][]. The second one is from [commit 45e4fd26683c][],
   which effectively removes creation of cache entries, except for PMTU
   exceptions.

!!! "Update (2018.08)" Here is a graph for more recent kernels.
Measures were performed on an [Intel Xeon Gold 6148][][^xeon] running
at 2.4 GHz, with GCC 6.3 from Debian Stretch. Performance regressions
in **4.4.147** and **4.9.119** are solely due to the Spectre
mitigations.[^meltdown] The small performance increase in Linux
**4.14** is from my own [commit feca7d8c135b][] which optimizes the
case without custom routing rules. In Linux **4.15**, the most notable
improvement can be traced to [commit 66f5d6ce53e6][]: Wei Wang
replaces the read-write lock by an RCU and a spinlock. In Linux
**4.18**, David Ahern [improved the data structures used by route
lookup][]. While the gain is meager, this should bring more
performance improvements in the future. This also allows a fairer
comparison between IPv4 and IPv6.

[^xeon]: That's the hardware we use to run hypervisors at [Exoscale][].

[^meltdown]: These LTS kernels received a backport of the mitigations
    found in more recent kernels. For IPv4, the impact was
    [non-existent][].
