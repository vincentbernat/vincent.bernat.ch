Here are the slides I presented for [SwiNOG #31][] at Berne,
Switzerland, in 2017. It covers [Exoscale][]'s use of BGP to turn a
hypervisor into a router without bridging while keeping the
virtual machines unaware of this change. You can find more details in
the "[L3 routing to the hypervisor with BGP][]" article.
