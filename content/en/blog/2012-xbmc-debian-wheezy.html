I bought some HTPC a few years ago to run [XBMC][], a neat media
center solution. At the time, to avoid any problems, I installed it on
top of a minimal Ubuntu Lucid installation with the official packages
from the team XBMC. Recently, [XBMC Eden has been released][eden] and
[XBMC has landed into Debian unstable][xbmc-debian]. It was a good
occasion to make the switch.

!!! "TL;DR" Installing XBMC on Debian Wheezy is quite easy: it almost
works out of the box. The big difficulty is the configuration of the
remote control: either it works as you expect or you will have to
scratch your head over the pile of layers needed to work with a remote
control.

The configuration of my HTPC is as follows:

 - an [Antec Micro Fusion 350 housing][antec] featuring a SoundGraph
   iMON IR receiver and LCD screen;[^lcd]
 - a Zotac ION-ITX-D-E motherboard with an Intel Atom 330 CPU and an
   nVidia ION chipset;
 - some Onkyo AV receiver connected through HDMI; and
 - a [Logitech Harmony 555][555] as remote control.

[^lcd]: The readibility of the LCD screen is very bad. You should look
        at the VFD version. The IR receiver reception is poor. The
        provided remote control is a joke.

# Installation

## Installing Debian Wheezy

Installing Debian Wheezy[^wheezy] is pretty easy.  Nowadays, getting a
bootable USB key from a
[_netinst_ image of Debian Installer for Wheezy][debian-installer] is
simplified:

    ::console
    $ sudo dd if=debian-testing-i386-netinst.iso \
    >         of=/dev/disk/by-id/usb...

[^wheezy]: Debian Wheezy is not yet released. If you are unfamiliar
           with Debian, it may be cumbersome to maintain it until the
           freeze happens in a few months.

The installation was smooth with the exception of GRUB which was
unable to install itself on the disk. This is a
[known bug][#662086] when dealing with LVM and it comes with a
simple workaround. I hope it will be corrected in time for Wheezy
release.

While this has little to do with the installation of XBMC, I wanted to
test [systemd][] which may become the default _init_ in Debian (at
least in Debian GNU/Linux). From `README.Debian`:

> `systemd` can be installed alongside `sysvinit` and will not change
> the behaviour of the system out of the box.  This is intentional.
> To test `systemd`, add `init=/bin/systemd` to the kernel command
> line and then rebooting, or install the `systemd-sysv` package.

The final system boots in about 15 seconds.

## Configuring X

Because [video decoding in _nouveau_ driver][video-nouveau] is still a
work in progress, the use of the proprietary NVIDIA drivers is
mandatory to be able to watch high resolution videos. Therefore,
`/etc/apt/sources.list` should be completed with `contrib` and
`non-free` repository. Then, you can install the appropriate packages:
`xserver-xorg-video-nvidia`, `nvidia-vdpau-driver` and `xserver-xorg`.

Here is my `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf`:

    ::
    Section "Device"
        Identifier     "NVidia ION"
        Driver         "nvidia"
        VendorName     "NVIDIA Corporation"
        Option         "HWCursor" "False"
        Option         "NoFlip" "False"
        Option         "FlatPanelProperties" "Scaling = Native"
        Option         "DynamicTwinView" "False"
        Option         "ConnectedMonitor" "DFP-1"
        Option         "CustomEDID" "DFP-1:/etc/X11/edid.bin"
        Option         "NoLogo" "True"
    EndSection

    Section "Extensions"
        Option "Composite" "false"
    EndSection

The `CustomEDID` option allows the driver to get an appropriate EDID
even when the AV receiver is off. You can get yours, free of charge,
with `get-edid` from `read-edid` package.

## Installing XBMC

Thanks to the work of Andrés Mejía, XBMC is now available in Debian
Wheezy. To install it, type `aptitude install xbmc`. I have
dropped the following `xbmc.service` in `/etc/systemd/system`
directory:

    ::
    [Unit]
    Description = XBMC media center
    After = syslog.target

    [Service]
    User = xbmc
    Group = xbmc
    Type = simple
    ExecStart = /usr/bin/xinit /usr/bin/xbmc-standalone -- :0
    Restart = on-failure

    [Install]
    WantedBy = multi-user.target

Enable this service on boot with `systemctl enable xbmc.service`. You
need to allow `xbmc` user to run X. The simplest way is to run
`dpkg-reconfigure -plow x11-common` and to allow anybody to run
X. `sudo` may be an alternative.

# Configuration

## Sound

While I wanted to use PulseAudio, I want the AV receiver to be
able to upmix stereo streams itself. With PulseAudio, it would always
receive a 6-channel signal. Therefore, I directly use ALSA.

First, unmute the appropriate outputs:

    ::console
    $ amixer scontrols | grep IEC958
    Simple mixer control 'IEC958',0
    Simple mixer control 'IEC958 Default PCM',0
    Simple mixer control 'IEC958',1
    $ amixer sset 'IEC958',0 unmute
    $ amixer sset 'IEC958 Default PCM',0 unmute
    $ amixer sset 'IEC958',1 unmute
    $ sudo systemctl stop alsa-utils.service

The order of channels is incorrect. With the following
`/etc/asound.conf`, we declare a new output, `hdmi2`, with a different
mapping:

    ::
    pcm.hdmi2 {
      type asym
      playback.pcm {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "remap-surround51"
      }
    }

    pcm.!remap-surround51 {
      type route
      slave.pcm "hdmi"
      ttable {
        0.0= 1
        1.1= 1
        2.4= 1
        3.5= 1
        4.2= 1
        5.3= 1
      }
    }

In XBMC, this output should be used instead of the default one. `hdmi`
should still be used for passthrough. To check if each speaker is
mapped correctly, one can use `speaker-test -D hdmi2 -c 6`.

## LCD display

The LCD display integrated into the SoundGraph iMON is supported by
the `imon` kernel module and the `lcdproc` package. I have only
modified a few lines of `/etc/LCDd.conf` to make it work:

    ::
    [server]
    Driver=imonlcd
    ServerScreen=off

    [imonlcd]
    Protocol=1
    OnExit=2
    Contrast=400

!!! "Update (2012-05)" The use of the LCD screen triggers various bugs
including segfaults of `ir-keytable` and freezes. Since its
readibility is less than ideal, I don't use it any more. I have
uninstalled `lcdproc` and I am using this simple script to switch it
off on start:

    ::python2
    #!/usr/bin/python

    import struct
    open("/dev/lcd0", "w").write(struct.pack("Q",0x8800000000000008))

This script is triggered by the following rule for `udev`:

    ::
    # Disable LCD screen
    ACTION=="add", NAME=="lcd0",
       RUN+="/usr/local/bin/disable_lcd"

## Remote control

This is the most difficult part. I have a Logitech Harmony remote
which is a great universal remote. Its support in Linux is acceptable:
you can configure through [Logitech website][harmony] and use
[congruity][] to push the new configuration.

### Remote controls and Linux

**Before Linux 2.6.36**, most remote controls would need LIRC to work:

 - The driver receives the signal from the IR receiver and make it
   available through `/dev/lirc`.
 - `lircd`, with the help of a configuration file describing the
   protocol used by the remote control, will read the signal and turn
   it into the appropriate LIRC code.
 - XBMC connects to `lircd` and receives incoming LIRC codes. It will
   translate them to an XBMC command. This translation is specified in
   `Lircmap.xml`.
 - XBMC maps each command to an action (like `Play`, `Fullscreen`,
   ...)  using a _keymap_. This keymap can handle commands received by
   a remote control, but also by a keyboard, a mouse or a joystick.

**Since Linux 2.6.36**, remote controls will be mapped as a generic
input device (just like a keyboard):

 - The driver receives the signal from the IR receiver.
 - The signal will be handled by a decoder. The configuration of this
   decoder is done in userland by `ir-keytable`. The decoder will
   turn the signal into the appropriate event (usually, some
   keypress).
 - X will listen to these events and turn them into X key events.
 - XBMC will receive them and use the appropriate _keymap_ to turn
   them into actions.

And to add more complexity to the mix, in this last case, you can
still use LIRC: `lircd` will listen to events generated by the kernel
and turn them into LIRC codes. This can be very confusing.

Moreover, the SoundGraph iMON IR receiver accepts two IR protocols:
the iMON protocol and the RC-6 one. The Linux driver accepts both of
them but uses the first one by default. The RC-6 protocol is the
protocol used by many MCE remote controls.

I hope you are still with me here.

### The easy way

To get a reasonable configuration out of the box, here is how to
configure each layer:

Logitech Harmony remote
: Configure it as a _Microsoft_ branded _Media Center PC_: _Windows
  Media Center SE_.

iMON IR receiver
: It must use RC-6 protocol. See below for more details.

LIRC
: In `/etc/lirc/hardware.conf`, put
  `DEVICE=/dev/input/by-id/usb-15c2_0038-event-if00` and
  `DRIVER=devinput`. In `/etc/lirc/lircd.conf`, just put `include
  "/usr/share/lirc/remotes/devinput/lircd.conf.devinput"`.

XBMC
: With the previous bits done, it should just work out of the box.

To switch to RC-6 protocol, install the `ir-keytable` package and use
the following commands:

    ::console
    $ sudo modprobe rc-imon-mce
    $ sudo ir-keytable -s rc0 -p rc-6 -c -w /lib/udev/rc_keymaps/imon_mce
    Read imon_mce table
    Old keytable cleared
    Wrote 77 keycode(s) to driver
    Protocols changed to RC-6 

To make the change permanent, add the `rc-imon-mce` module to
`/etc/modules` and create `/etc/udev/rules.d/90-imon.rules` with the
following content:

    ::
    # Override the keytable for iMON
    ACTION=="add|change", SUBSYSTEM=="rc", DRV_NAME="imon", \
       RUN+="/usr/bin/ir-keytable -s $name -p rc-6 -c -w /lib/udev/rc_keymaps/imon_mce"

### The hard way

Now, you may want to bind custom actions to some (physical or virtual)
buttons. You are left with two solutions:

 1. Start from the basic configuration with LIRC and add more buttons
    at each levels (there are five of them!).
 2. Remove LIRC and start with the Logitech Harmony acting as a
    Microsoft MCE keyboard.

The first option can be quite difficult. You need to find an unused
code for the Logitech Harmony. You can try to make it learn a new code
if you have some RC-6 remote control. Then, you need to ensure that
this code will be present in the keytable used by `ir-keytable`. If
not, you need to add it. That's not easy since you need a
[to enable some debug stuff in the kernel][prdebug] to find the
appropriate scancode. After that, the code needs to be translated in
`lircd.conf`. You will then have to translate it again in
`Lircmap.xml`. At least, you need to add it to a keymap in XBMC.

The other way is not ideal but seems less cumbersome. The first step
is to configure the Logitech Harmony as a _Microsoft MCE keyboard_: it
has a lot of available keys. Because of the lack of multimedia keys,
let's match the keyboard configuration of XBMC:

Button       | Command            | Button       | Command    
------------ | ------------------ | ------------ | ----------
Channel Down | `PageDown`         | Stop         | `X`                    
Channel Up   | `PageUp`           | Skip back    | `Comma`                
Prev         | `Backspace`        | Skip forward | `.`                    
Up           | `DirectionUp`      | Play         | `P`                    
Down         | `DirectionDown`    | Rewind       | `R`                    
Left         | `DirectionLeft`    | Fast forward | `F`                    
Right        | `DirectionRight`   | Star         | `Delete`               
OK           | `Enter`            | Pound        | `W`                    
Menu         | `C`                | Red          | `F1`                   
Exit         | `Esc`              | Green        | `F2`                   
Guide        | `Tab`              | Yellow       | `F3`                   
Info         | `I`                | Blue         | `F4`

Unfortunately, the keytables provided with `ir-keytable` are not
complete enough. I have built a
[more complete table][imon_mce].[^missing] With this table and the
bindings described above, most functions will work out of the box
without LIRC.

[^missing]: Some keys are missing from the provided table. For
            example, there is no exclamation mark. While there is a
            scan code for such a key in RC-6 protocol, there is no
            appropriate key code to translate to: on a QWERTY
            keyboard, the exclamation mark is on the same key as the
            number 1. It is possible to map it to some other key code,
            but the mapping would have been difficult to use.

Additional keys can be configured in a dedicated keymap.[^keymap] Here
is an excerpt of [mine][keymap]:

    ::xml
    <keymap>
     <global>
      <keyboard>
        <end>XBMC.ShutDown()</end>
        <f1>XBMC.ActivateWindow(MusicLibrary)</f1>
        <f2>XBMC.ActivateWindow(Videos,TvShowTitles)</f2>
        <f3>XBMC.ActivateWindow(Videos,MovieTitles)</f3>
        <f4>XBMC.ActivateWindow(Weather)</f4>
      </keyboard>
     </global>
     <FullscreenVideo>
      <keyboard>
       <opensquarebracket>SubtitleDelayMinus</opensquarebracket>
       <closesquarebracket>SubtitleDelayPlus</closesquarebracket>
       <f6>xbmc.runscript(script.xbmc.subtitles)</f6>
      </keyboard>
     </FullscreenVideo>
    </keymap>

[^keymap]: For example, in `~/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps/harmony.xml`.

## FTP

Instead of using SSH, I prefer to drop new files with anonymous
FTP. _vsftpd_ fits this purpose. Here is my configuration file:

    ::
    listen=YES
    xferlog_enable=YES
    use_localtime=YES
    setproctitle_enable=YES

    secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty
    nopriv_user=ftp
    ftpd_banner=XBMC
    hide_ids=YES

    ftp_username=xbmc
    anon_umask=022
    anon_root=/home/xbmc/media
    anonymous_enable=YES
    write_enable=YES
    anon_upload_enable=YES
    anon_world_readable_only=YES

It is currently not compatible with _systemd_ (see bug [#670308][]). I
have removed the symlink in `/etc/rc2.d` and I have used the following
unit file:

    ::
    [Unit]
    Description=Vsftpd ftp daemon
    After=syslog.target network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/vsftpd /etc/vsftpd.conf
    ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
    ExecStartPre=-/bin/mkdir -p /var/run/vsftpd/empty

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target


## Miscellaneous

 1. In `/etc/default/grub`, reduce `TIMEOUT` to 0 to shorten the boot
    time.

 2. Enabling [dirty regions][dirtyregions] can help speed up XBMC.

 3. `aptitude install upower pm-utils` to be able to shutdown/suspend
    from XBMC. Since XBMC was configured to be started outside any
    session, you need to explicitly give the appropriate rights by
    creating the following
    `/var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/xbmc.pkla`:
    
        ::
        [Actions for xbmc user]
        Identity=unix-user:xbmc
        Action=org.freedesktop.upower.*;org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.*
        ResultAny=yes
        ResultInactive=yes
        ResultActive=yes
