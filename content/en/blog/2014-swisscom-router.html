I have recently moved to Lausanne, Switzerland. Broadband Internet
access is not as cheap as in France. [Free][], a French ISP, is
providing an FTTH access with a bandwidth of 1 Gbps[^bandwidthfree] for
about 38 € (including TV and phone service), [Swisscom][] is providing
roughly the same service for about 200 €.[^swisscomprice1] Swisscom
fiber access was available for my appartment and I chose the 40 Mbps
contract without phone service for about 80 €.

[^bandwidthfree]: Maximum download speed is 1 Gbps, while maximum
                 upload speed is 200 Mbps.

[^swisscomprice1]: This is the standard [Vivo XL package][] rated at
                   CHF 169.– plus the 1 Gbps option at
                   CHF 80.–. Meantime, the bandwidth for this package
                   has been upgraded to 1 Gbps (symmetrical) for the
                   same price.

Like many ISP, Swisscom provides an [Internet box][] with an
additional box for TV. I didn't unpack the TV box as I have no use for
it. The Internet box comes with some nice features like the ability to
setup firewall rules, a guest wireless access and some file sharing
possibilities. No shell access!

I have bought a small PC to act as router and replace the Internet
box. I have loaded the upcoming [Debian Jessie][] on it. You can find
the whole software configuration in a [Git repository][].

This blog post only covers the Swisscom-specific setup (and QoS). Have
a look at these two blog posts for related topics:

 - [Staging a Netfilter ruleset in a network namespace][]
 - [Intel Wireless 7260 as an access point][]


# Ethernet

The Internet box is packed with a Siligence-branded 1000BX
SFP.[^sfp] This SFP receives and transmits data on the same fiber
using a different wavelength for each direction.

[^sfp]: There are two references on it: SGA 441SFP0-1Gb and
        OST-1000BX-S34-10DI. It transmits to the 1310 nm wave length
        and receives on the 1490 nm one.

Instead of using a network card with an SFP port, I bought a
[Netgear GS110TP][] which comes with 8 gigabit copper ports and 2
fiber SFP ports. It is a cheap switch bundled with many interesting
features like VLAN and LLDP. It works fine if you don't expect too
much from it.

# IPv4

IPv4 connectivity is provided over VLAN 10. A DHCP client is
mandatory. Moreover, the **DHCP vendor class identifier option (option
60)** needs to be advertised. This can be done by adding the following
line to `/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf` when using the ISC DHCP client:

    send vendor-class-identifier "100008,0001,,Debian";

The first two numbers are here to identify the service you are
requesting. I suppose this can be read as requesting the Swisscom
residential access service. You can put whatever you want after
that. Once you get a lease, you need to use a browser to identify
yourself to Swisscom on the first use.

# IPv6

Swisscom provides IPv6 access through the [6rd protocol][]. This is a
tunneling mechanism to facilitate IPv6 deployment across an IPv4
infrastructure. This kind of tunnel is natively supported by Linux
since kernel version 2.6.33.

To setup IPv6, you need the base IPv6 prefix and the 6rd gateway. Some
ISP are providing these values through DHCP (option 212) but this is
not the case for Swisscom. The gateway is `6rd.swisscom.com` and the
prefix is `2a02:1200::/28`. After appending the IPv4 address to the
prefix, you still get 4 bits for internal subnets.

Swisscom doesn't provide a fixed IPv4 address. Therefore, it is not
possible to precompute the IPv6 prefix. When installed as a DHCP hook
(in `/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/6rd`), the following script
configures the tunnel:

    ::sh
    sixrd_iface=internet6
    sixrd_mtu=1472                  # This is 1500 - 20 - 8 (PPPoE header)
    sixrd_ttl=64
    sixrd_prefix=2a02:1200::/28     # No way to guess, just have to know it.
    sixrd_br=193.5.29.1             # That's "6rd.swisscom.com"
    
    sixrd_down() {
        ip tunnel del ${sixrd_iface} || true
    }
    
    sixrd_up() {
        ipv4=${new_ip_address:-$old_ip_address}
    
        sixrd_subnet=$(ruby <<EOF
    require 'ipaddr'
    prefix = IPAddr.new "${sixrd_prefix}", Socket::AF_INET6
    prefixlen = ${sixrd_prefix#*/}
    ipv4 = IPAddr.new "${ipv4}", Socket::AF_INET
    ipv6 = IPAddr.new (prefix.to_i + (ipv4.to_i << (64 + 32 - prefixlen))), Socket::AF_INET6
    puts ipv6
    EOF
    )
    
        # Let's configure the tunnel
        ip tunnel add ${sixrd_iface} mode sit local $ipv4 ttl $sixrd_ttl
        ip tunnel 6rd dev ${sixrd_iface} 6rd-prefix ${sixrd_prefix}
        ip addr add ${sixrd_subnet}1/64 dev ${sixrd_iface}
        ip link set mtu ${sixrd_mtu} dev ${sixrd_iface}
        ip link set ${sixrd_iface} up
        ip route add default via ::${sixrd_br} dev ${sixrd_iface}
    }
    
    case $reason in
        BOUND|REBOOT)
            sixrd_down
            sixrd_up
            ;;
        RENEW|REBIND)
            if [ "$new_ip_address" != "$old_ip_address" ]; then
                sixrd_down
                sixrd_up
            fi
            ;;
        STOP|EXPIRE|FAIL|RELEASE)
            sixrd_down
            ;;
    esac

The computation of the IPv6 prefix is offloaded to Ruby instead of
trying to use the shell for that. Even if the `ipaddr` module is
pretty "basic," it suits the job.

Swisscom is using the same MTU for all clients. Because some of them
are using PPPoE, the MTU is 1472 instead of 1480. <del>You can easily check
your MTU with this [handy online MTU test tool][].</del>

It is not uncommon that PMTUD is broken on some parts of the
Internet. While not ideal, setting up [TCP MSS][] will alievate any
problem you may run into with a MTU less than 1500:

    ::sh
    ip6tables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -o internet6 \
              -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \
              -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu

# QoS

!!! "Update (2014-11)" Unfortunately, this section is incorrect,
including its premise. Have a look at [Dave Taht comment][] for more
details. As an alternative, [Gentoo's wiki][] contains simple
instructions to setup an effective traffic shaping.

 <del>Once upon a time, QoS was a tacky subject. The [Wonder Shaper][] was a
common way to get a somewhat working setup. Nowadays, thanks to the
work of the [Bufferbloat project][], there are two simple steps to get
something quite good:</del>

 1. <del>**Reduce the queue** of your devices to something like 32
    packets. This helps TCP to detect congestion and act accordingly
    while still being able to saturate a gigabit link.</del>

        ip link set txqueuelen 32 dev lan
        ip link set txqueuelen 32 dev internet
        ip link set txqueuelen 32 dev wlan

 2. <del>**Change the root *qdisc* to `fq_codel`**. A *qdisc* receives packets
    to be sent from the kernel and decide how packets are handled to
    the network card. Packets can be dropped, reordered or
    rate-limited. [`fq_codel`][fq_codel] is a queuing discipline
    combining fair queuing and controlled delay. **Fair queuing**
    means that all flows get an equal chance to be served. Another way
    to tell it is that a high-bandwidth flow won't starve the
    queue. **Controlled delay** means that the queue size will be
    limited to ensure the latency stays low. This is achieved by
    dropping packets more aggressively when the queue grows.</del>

        tc qdisc replace dev lan root fq_codel
        tc qdisc replace dev internet root fq_codel
        tc qdisc replace dev wlan root fq_codel
