On a BGP-routed network with multiple redundant paths, we seek to
achieve two goals concerning reliability:

 1. A failure on a path should **quickly bring down** the related BGP
    sessions. A common expectation is to recover in less than a second
    by diverting the traffic to the remaining paths.

 2. As long as a path is operational, the related BGP sessions
    should **stay up**, even under duress.

# Detecting failures fast: BFD

To quickly detect a failure, BGP can be associated with BFD, a
protocol to detect faults in bidirectional paths,[^undetected] defined
in [RFC 5880][] and [RFC 5882][]. BFD can use very low timers, like
100 ms.

However, when BFD runs in a process on top of a generic kernel,[^cp]
notably when [running BGP on the host][], it is not unexpected to
loose a few BFD packets on adverse conditions: the daemon handling the
BFD sessions may not get enough CPU to answer in a timely manner. In
this scenario, it is not unlikely for all the BGP sessions to go down
at the same time, creating an outage, as depicted in the last case in
the diagram below.

![BGP and failed sessions]([[!!images/bgp-llgr-nollgr.svg]] "Examples
of failures on a network using BGP as the underlying routing protocol.
A link failure is detected by BFD and the failed path is removed from
the ECMP route. However, when high CPU usage on the bottom router
prevents BFD packets to be processed timely, all paths are removed.")

[^undetected]: With point-to-point links, BGP can immediately detect a
    failure without BFD. However, with a pair of fibers, the failure
    may be undirectional, leaving it undetected by the other end until
    the expiration of the hold timer.

[^cp]: On a Juniper MX, BFD is usually handled directly by the
    real-time microkernel running on the packet forwarding engine. The
    BFD control packet contains a bit indicating if BFD is implemented
    by the forwarding plane or by the control plane. Therefore, you
    can check with `tcpdump` how a router implements BFD. Here is an
    example where `10.71.7.1`, a Linux host running *BIRD*, implements
    BFD in the control plane, while `10.71.0.3`, a Juniper MX, does
    not:

        ::console
        $ sudo tcpdump -pni vlan181 port 3784
        IP 10.71.7.1 > 10.71.0.3: BFDv1, Control, State Up, Flags: [none]
        IP 10.71.0.3 > 10.71.7.1: BFDv1, Control, State Up, Flags: [Control Plane Independent]

    On Juniper, you can also check at which level BFD is handled using
    the `show ppm adjacencies protocol bfd details` command. If the
    BFD session is marked as not distributed, it is handled by the
    routing engine CPU. Otherwise, you need to use the `show ppm
    adjacencies` command on the corresponding FPC. If the BFD session
    is "inline," the session is handled at the lowest level by the
    NPU. Otherwise, it is handled by the linecard CPU (running a
    realtime Linux kernel).

So far, we have two contradicting roads:

 - lower the BFD timers to quickly detect a failure along the path, or
 - raise the BFD timers to ensure BGP sessions remain operational.

# Fix false positives: BGP LLGR

Long-lived BGP Graceful Restart is a new BGP capability to retain
**stale routes** for a longer period after a session failure but
treating them as **least-preferred**. It also defines a well-known
community to share this information with other routers. It is defined
in the Internet-Draft [draft-uttaro-idr-bgp-persistence-05][] and
several implementations already exist:

 - Juniper JunOS (since 15.1, see the [documentation][junos]),
 - Cisco IOS XR (unfortunately only for VPN and FlowSpec families),
 - BIRD (since 1.6.5 and 2.0.3),
   and
 - GoBGP (since 1.33).

The following illustration shows what happens during two failure
scenarios. Like without LLGR, in ❷, a link failure is detected by BFD
and the failed path is removed from the route as two other paths
remain with a higher preference. A couple of minutes later, the faulty
path has its stale timer expired and will not be used anymore. Shortly
after, in ❸, the bottom router experiences high CPU usage, preventing
BFD packets to be processed timely. The BGP sessions are closed and
the remaining paths become stale but as there is no better path left,
they are still used until the LLGR timer expires. In the meantime, we
expect the BGP sessions to resume.

![BGP with LLGR]([[!!images/bgp-llgr-llgr.svg]] "Examples of failures
on a network using BGP as the underlying routing protocol with LLGR
enabled.")

From the point of view of the top router, the first failed path was
considered as stale because the BGP session with R1 was down.
However, during the second failure, the two remaining paths were
considered as stale because they were tagged with the well-known
community `LLGR_STALE` (65535:6) by R2 and R3.

Another interesting point of BGP LLGR is the ability to **restart the
BGP daemon without any impact**—as long as all paths keep a steady
state shortly before and during restart. This is quite interesting
when [running BGP on the host][].[^gr]

[^gr]: Such a feature is the selling point of BGP graceful restart.
    However, without LLGR, non-functional paths are kept with the same
    preference and are not removed from ECMP routes.

## BIRD

Let's see how to configure *BIRD* 1.6. As BGP LLGR is built on top of
the regular BGP graceful restart (BGP GR) capability, we need to
enable both. The timer for BGP LLGR starts after the timer for BGP GR.
During a regular graceful restart, routes are kept with the same
preference. Therefore it is important to set this timer to 0.

    ::junos
    template bgp BGP_LLGR {
      bfd graceful;
      graceful restart yes;
      graceful restart time 0;
      long lived graceful restart yes;
      long lived stale time 120;
    }

When a problem appears on the path, the BGP session goes down and the
LLGR timer starts:

    ::console hl_lines="13 16 17"
    $ birdc show protocol R1_1 all
    name     proto    table    state  since       info
    R1_1     BGP      master   start  11:20:17    Connect
      Preference:     100
      Input filter:   ACCEPT
      Output filter:  ACCEPT
      Routes:         1 imported, 0 exported, 0 preferred
      Route change stats:     received   rejected   filtered    ignored   accepted
        Import updates:              2          0          0          0          4
        Import withdraws:            0          0        ---          0          0
        Export updates:             12         10          0        ---          2
        Export withdraws:            1        ---        ---        ---          0
      BGP state:          Connect
        Neighbor address: 2001:db8:104::1
        Neighbor AS:      65000
        Neighbor graceful restart active
        LL stale timer:   112/-

The related paths are marked as stale (as reported by the `s` in
`100s`) and tagged with the well-known community `LLGR_STALE`:

    ::console hl_lines="8 14"
    $ birdc show route 2001:db8:10::1/128 all
    2001:db8:10::1/128 via 2001:db8:204::1 on eth0.204 [R1_2 10:35:01] * (100) [i]
            Type: BGP unicast univ
            BGP.origin: IGP
            BGP.as_path:
            BGP.next_hop: 2001:db8:204::1 fe80::5254:3300:cc00:5
            BGP.local_pref: 100
                       via 2001:db8:104::1 on eth0.104 [R1_1 11:22:51] (100s) [i]
            Type: BGP unicast univ
            BGP.origin: IGP
            BGP.as_path:
            BGP.next_hop: 2001:db8:104::1 fe80::5254:3300:6800:5
            BGP.local_pref: 100
            BGP.community: (65535,6)

We are left with only one path for the route in the kernel:

    ::console
    $ ip route show 2001:db8:10::1
    2001:db8:10::1 via 2001:db8:204::1 dev eth0.204 proto bird metric 1024 pref medium

To upgrade *BIRD* without impact, it needs to run with the `-R` flag
and the `graceful restart yes` directive should be present in the
`kernel` protocols. Then, before upgrade, stop it using `SIGKILL`
instead of `SIGTERM` to avoid a clean close of the BGP sessions.

## Juniper JunOS

With *JunOS*, we only have to enable BGP LLGR for each family—assuming
BFD is already configured:

    ::junos
    # Enable BGP LLGR
    edit protocols bgp group peers family inet6 unicast
    set graceful-restart long-lived restarter stale-time 2m

Once a path is failing, the associated BGP session goes down and the
BGP LLGR timer starts:

    ::console hl_lines="5 10 16 24"
    > show bgp neighbor 2001:db8:104::4
    Peer: 2001:db8:104::4+179 AS 65000 Local: 2001:db8:104::1+57667 AS 65000
      Group: peers                 Routing-Instance: master
      Forwarding routing-instance: master
      Type: Internal    State: Connect        Flags: <>
      Last State: Active        Last Event: ConnectRetry
      Last Error: None
      Export: [ LOOPBACK NOTHING ]
      Options: <Preference HoldTime Ttl AddressFamily Multipath Refresh>
      Options: <BfdEnabled LLGR>
      Address families configured: inet6-unicast
      Holdtime: 6 Preference: 170
      NLRI inet6-unicast:
      Number of flaps: 2
      Last flap event: Restart
      Time until long-lived stale routes deleted: inet6-unicast 00:01:05
      Table inet6.0 Bit: 20000
        RIB State: BGP restart is complete
        Send state: not advertising
        Active prefixes:              0
        Received prefixes:            1

        Suppressed due to damping:    0
        LLGR-stale prefixes:          1

The associated path is marked as stale and is therefore inactive as
there are better paths available:

    ::console hl_lines="10 13 14"
    > show route 2001:db8:10::4 extensive
    […]

Have a look at the [Git repository][] for the complete
configurations as well as the expected outputs during normal
operations. There is also a [variant][] with the configurations of
*BIRD* and *JunOS* when acting as a BGP route reflector. Now that [FRR
got BFD support][], I hope it will get [LLGR support][] as well.
