[Org mode][] is a package for Emacs to "keep notes, maintain todo
lists, planning projects and authoring documents." It can execute
embedded snippets of code and capture the output
(through [Babel][]). It's an invaluable tool
for [documenting your infrastructure and your operations][devops].

Here are three (relatively) short videos exhibiting *Org mode* use in
the context of **network operations**. In all of them, I am using my
own [junos-mode][] which features the following perks:

 - **syntax highlighting** for configuration files,
 - commit of **configuration snippets** to remote devices, and
 - execution of **remote commands**.

Since some Junos devices can be quite slow, commits and remote
executions are done asynchronously[^async] with the help of a Python
helper.

[^async]: This is a bit of a hack since *Babel* doesn't have native
    support for that. Also have a look at [ob-async][] which is a
    language-independent implementation of the same idea.
    
In the first video, I take some **notes** about configuring BGP
*add-path* feature ([RFC 7911][]). It demonstrates all the available
features of [junos-mode][].

In the second video, I execute a **planned operation** to enable this
feature in production. The document is a *modus operandi* and contains
the configuration to apply and the commands to check if it works as
expected. At the end, the document becomes a detailed report of the
operation.

In the third video, a **cookbook** has been prepared to execute some
changes. I set some variables and execute the cookbook to apply the
change and check the result.
