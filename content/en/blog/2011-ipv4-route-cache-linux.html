**Deprecation notice**: The information presented in this article are
outdated since the route cache has been removed from Linux 3.6.

The route cache is a Linux kernel component enabling route lookups to
be faster by caching the results in some table and checking it before
issuing a regular lookup in the route tables. When using Linux as a
router, the inefficiency of the route cache can hinder the
performances of your box.

The documentation on this component is scarce and it is difficult to
find up-to-date bits on how the route cache works and how to tune
it. The book *[Understanding Linux Network Internals][understanding]*
from O'Reilly is an exception and contains valuable information on how
the route cache works. Even if the book is targeted at 2.6.12, the
part on the route cache is still quite accurate. Unfortunately, it
fails to provide appropriate tips on how to monitor and tune the route
cache.

I hope to provide here a concise view of the route cache, as it is
implemented in **Linux 3.1**[^valid]. It is protocol-dependent[^dst]
and I will cover only the **IPv4** version here.

[^valid]: The content of this article should be valid for Linux
          2.6.38, 2.6.39, 3.0 and 3.1. There are some clues for Linux
          2.6.35, 2.6.36 and 2.6.37 as well as for Linux 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
          and 3.5. Starting from Linux 3.6, the whole
          [route cache has been removed][removed].

[^dst]: Linux provides a protocol-independent destination cache
        subsystem (DST). This component is not a generic cache layer
        and only enables loose coupling with external subsystems.

[TOC]

# Overview of the route cache subsystem

To handle an incoming or outgoing IP datagram, the kernel needs to
issue a lookup in the route tables. While it seems to be quite
trivial, several questions need to be answered:

 - Does the source address and the destination address appear to be valid?
 - Is the source address a martian address[^martian]?
 - Is the destination address mine or should I forward the packet?
 - Which route table should I use?
 - Does the destination address match this route? And this one?
 - Can I currently contact the gateway that I should use?

[^martian]: Martian addresses are addresses that cannot be used as a
            source address, either because they are reserved for
            special-use (like a multicast address) or because of the
            use of *reverse path filtering* which checks if a packet
            received on one interface would be answered on the same
            interface, as defined in [RFC 3704][rfc3704]. This feature
            is enabled by setting `rp_filter` in Linux.

Those checks can be a bit time consuming, even for small route
tables. To avoid them for each packets, Linux maintains a *route
cache* which is queried before doing a regular lookup and updated
after each one. You can dump it with `ip -s route show cache`:

    ::console
    $ ip -s route show cache
    198.51.100.7 from 203.0.113.2 via 192.0.2.1 dev eth1
      cache used 7 age 2sec ipid 0x1fce rtt 131ms rttvar 45ms cwnd 10
    198.51.100.17 from 203.0.113.15 via 192.0.2.1 dev eth1
      cache used 3 age 0sec ipid 0xc3bd
    local 192.0.2.18 from 203.0.113.15 dev lo src 192.0.2.18
      cache <local> used 154 age 1sec iif eth0

Here are two examples:

 - If Linux receives a packet from **203.0.113.15** to **198.51.100.17**,
   it will find this flow in the route
   cache. Therefore, it already knows that it should forward the packet
   to 192.0.2.1. No checks needed.
 - If it receives a packet from from **203.0.113.16** to **198.51.100.17**,
   there is no appropriate entry in the route cache
   and therefore, the system will have to look at the route tables. It
   is likely to use the exact same entry than if the source was
   203.0.113.15 but maybe there is some policy routing requesting the
   use of a special route table or 203.0.113.16 is a local address
   and the packet will therefore be classified as *martian*.

The schema below shows how this cache is implemented[^src]. It uses a
separate [hash table][hash] (BSD systems keep the cache in the routing
table). Each bucket is a chained list of route cache entries.

[^src]: For more details, you may want to look at `include/net/dst.h`,
        `include/net/route.h` and `net/ipv4/route.c`.

![Schema of the route cache hash table][rthashtable]
[rthashtable]: [[!!images/linux/routing-cache.png]] "Partial view of the route cache hash table with three cached entries"

Once an entry has been added to the route cache, there are several
ways to remove it. Most entries are removed by the
[garbage collector][gc] which will scan the route cache and remove
invalid and older entries. It will be triggered when the route cache
is full or at regular interval, once a certain threshold has been met.

## Available knobs

There are several values you can tune. Most of them are available in
`sysctl`.

 - `rhash_entries` is the **size of the hash table**[^size]. If you
   don't specify it on the kernel command line, it is computed
   dynamically based on the memory available on your system. You can
   view its value by looking at something like `IP route cache hash
   table entries: 262144 (order: 9, 2097152 bytes)` in the kernel
   logs.
 - `net.ipv4.route.max_size` is the **maximum number of entries** in
   the route cache. Except under exceptional circumstances, this value
   is never exceeded.
 - `net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity` is the target **average length of a
   chain** in the route cache. The garbage collector will work harder
   if this value is exceeded. This means that if you multiply this
   value by the value of `rhash_entries`, you will get the target
   average number of entries in the route cache.
 - `net.ipv4.route.gc_min_interval_ms` is the **minimum delay between
   two runs of the garbage collector**, except when the cache is
   full. The default value should be fine.
 - `net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh` is a **threshold triggering the garbage
   collector** every `net.ipv4.route.gc_min_interval_ms` milliseconds.
 - `net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout` is the base value to determine if an
   **entry is old enough to be removed** or not. Whatever its value,
   the garbage collector will attempt to remove the same number of
   entries. However, this value could potentially influence its
   efficiency. See below for more details on this.

[^size]: In fact, the size of the hash table is always a power of
         two. If specified, `rhash_entries` is rounded to the next
         power of two and, internally, is stored as `rt_hash_mask +
         1`.

You may find documentation about those obsolete *sysctl* values:

 - `net.ipv4.route.secret_interval` has been
   [removed in Linux 2.6.35][secret]; it was used to trigger an
   asynchronous flush at fixed interval to avoid to fill the cache.
 - `net.ipv4.route.gc_interval` has been
   [removed in Linux 2.6.38][gcinterval]. It is still present until
   Linux 3.2 but has no effect. It was used to trigger an asynchronous
   cleanup of the route cache. The garbage collector is now considered
   efficient enough for the job.

**UPDATED:** `net.ipv4.route.gc_interval`
[is back for Linux 3.2][gcinterval2]. It is still needed to avoid
exhausting the neighbour cache because it allows to cleanup the cache
periodically and not only above a given threshold. Keep it to its
default value of 60.

## Statistics & monitoring

Linux maintains some statistics about the use of the route
cache. You can find them in `/proc/net/stat/rt_cache`. The command
`lnstat` can print them nicely for you:

    ::console
    $ lnstat -s1 -i1 -c-1 -f rt_cache
    rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|
     entries|  in_hit|in_slow_|in_slow_|in_no_ro|  in_brd|in_marti|in_marti| out_hit|out_slow|out_slow|gc_total|gc_ignor|gc_goal_|gc_dst_o|in_hlist|out_hlis|
            |        |     tot|      mc|     ute|        |  an_dst|  an_src|        |    _tot|     _mc|        |      ed|    miss| verflow| _search|t_search|
     3096848|   42309|     686|       0|       0|       0|       0|       0|       3|       0|       0|     674|     672|       0|       0|   27644|       8|
     3096984|   41405|     636|       0|       0|       0|       0|       0|       3|       0|       0|     623|     621|       0|       0|   28189|       8|
     3097160|   42483|     700|       0|       0|       0|       0|       0|       5|       0|       0|     694|     692|       0|       0|   29506|      12|

Except for the first column, `lnstat` outputs values in units per
second. Let's review some of those values:

 - `rt_cache_entries` is the number of entries in the route cache. You
   should compare it with `net.ipv4.route.max_size` and ensure that
   the **cache is never full** to avoid triggering the garbage
   collector too often.
 - `rt_cache_in_hit` and `rt_cache_out_hit` are the number of regular
   lookups avoided because the result was found in the cache for
   incoming and outgoing packets, respectively. When the system is a
   router, most lookups only happen on the incoming side. You should
   compare this value with `rt_cache_in_slow_tot` and
   `rt_cache_in_out_slow_tot` which are the number of lookups in the
   route tables. On this system, the **efficiency** of the route cache
   is more than 98% which is quite good.
 - `rt_cache_gc_total` is how often the garbage collector was
   requested to be triggered while `rt_cache_gc_ignored` corresponds
   to how often it was finally not run because it has already been
   triggered shortly beforehand (less than
   `net.ipv4.route.gc_min_interval_ms` milliseconds). The difference
   between those two values should be very small to ensure that the
   garbage collector does not run more a handful of times per second.
 - `rt_cache_gc_goal_miss` is how often the garbage collector was not
   able to fulfill its goal. This value should rarely be different of
   0.
 - `rt_cache_gc_dst_overflow` is how often the route cache is bigger
   than the allowed maximum size. This should never happen except
   when you try to shrink the cache.
 - `rt_cache_in_hlist_search` and `rt_cache_out_hlist_search` is how
   often a lookup in the cache had to look at the next entry in the
   chain for the computed bucket: each time Linux has to follow the
   `next` pointer in a cache entry, it increments one of those
   counters. It is a clue on the average length of chains in the route
   cache hash table. Compare those values with the number of cache
   lookups (hit and miss).

As an illustration, here is a plot of the various statistics exposed
above for a router whose route cache receives about 1000 routes par
second:

![Plot of various statistics for the route cache][rtstats]
[rtstats]: [[!!images/linux/routing-cache-stats.png]] "Various statistics about the route cache"

`rhash_entries` is 1,048,576, as is
`net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh`. Therefore, the garbage collector was
requested to be run when the number of entries goes above this
level. Because the cache is not full, it is only really run twice per
seconds (the value of `net.ipv4.route.gc_interval_ms` is
500). `net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity` is set to 3. This explains why
the garbage collector is aggressive when the number of entries reached
3,145,728.

As you can see, the efficiency is near 100% all the time. The
percentage of collisions is `rt_cache_in_hlist_search` ratio to the
sum of `rt_cache_in_hit` and `rt_cache_in_slow_tot`.

**UPDATED:** The plot above was with a 2.6.39 kernel. For a kernel
between 2.6.35 and 2.6.37 (included) or a 3.2 kernel or more recent,
the cleanup triggered every `net.ipv4.route.gc_interval` seconds will
expire up to `rhash_entries` entries. If the pace at which routes are
added to the cache is less than this rate, the number of entries may
stop climbing, even when `net.ipv4.route.gc_threshold` is not met. For
example, here are the same statistics with a 2.6.35 kernel for a
router with about 2,500 new entries per second but with
`net.ipv4.route.gc_interval` enabled; the threshold of 1,048,576 is
never met:

![Plot of various statistics for the route cache with gc_interval][rtstats2]
[rtstats2]: [[!!images/linux/routing-cache-gc-interval.png]] "Various statistics about the route cache with gc_interval set to 60"

## Tuning

Do you need to modify any of those values? You have two questions to
ask yourself:

 1. How much efficiency do you want to get from the route cache?
 2. How much memory do you want to dedicate to the route cache?

As a rule of thumb, two millions entries eat about 500 MB of memory on
a 64bit system. You should be able to compute the average memory usage
and the maximum memory usage from the values of
`net.ipv4.route.max_size`, `rhash_entries` and
`net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity`. For example, if the route cache hash
table has 262,144 buckets, the maximum allowed number of entries in
the cache is 4,194,304 and `net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity` is set to 8,
the memory usage will be 500 MB on average and 1 GB max. If this is
too much, you will need to lower some values.

Look at the previous section to compute the current efficiency of your
route cache. It should be above 90%. If you are dissatisfied with
that, you could increase the cache size.

If you want to double the number of entries, double
`net.ipv4.route.max_size`, `net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh` and
`rhash_entries` but keep `net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity` to 8.

For the garbage collector to be efficient, the route cache should not
be filled too fast. The garbage collector should be able to cope with
this situation but this may impact performance because it needs to
walk several times the route cache to find entries to expire. Watching
`gc_goal_miss` may give you a hint about this: if this value starts to
be different of 0, lower `net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout`.

**UPDATED:** For a kernel where `net.ipv4.route.gc_interval` matters,
things become more complicated. Because the cleanup algorithm will
expire entries at a regular interval, the average number of entries
may stay low unless the number of new entries per second is high
enough. Therefore, the average number of entries may be lower than the
theoretical value computed above. Monitoring the appropriate metrics
is the key to a good tuning. If you feel that entries are expired too
fast, you may want to double `net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout`.

# In-depth look into the garbage collector

Those different pieces of advice may have puzzled you. We need to
understand how the garbage collector works to better cope with
them. The garbage collector is triggered when a new entry needs to be
added to the cache and the number of entries is superior to
`net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh`. It is implemented in
[`rt_garbage_collect()` function][rtgarbagecollect]. It will do
nothing if it has been called less than
`net.ipv4.route.gc_interval_ms` milliseconds and the cache is not full
(more than `net.ipv4.route.max_size` entries).

## Setting a goal

The garbage collector will first assess the situation. It will look how
the number of entries currently in the cache compares to the product
of `rhash_entries` and `net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity`:

 1. Above this limit, it will try to remove at least
    `rhash_entries` entries.
 2. Otherwise, it will try to remove no more than half the difference.

If you look at the previous plot, you can easily see the difference
when the garbage collector is not aggressive (above 1,048,576 entries
but below 3,145,728) and when it is (above 3,145,728 entries). If we
assume the garbage collector is able to meet its goal, we can easily
[simulate its algorithm][simul]:

![Plot showing influence of various kernel parameters][experiments]
[experiments]: [[!!images/linux/routing-cache-exp.png]] "Variations of various cache parameters and their effects"

The first plot shows what would happen if about 2000 routes are added
per second with `rhash_entries` equal to 262,144 and
`net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity` set to 8. When
`net.ipv4.route.gc_threshold` is met, the garbage collector has almost
no effect. However, when the number of entries reaches 2,097,152, the
garbage collector sets its goal to 262,144. From this point, the number
of entries oscillates around 2 millions entries.

On the second plot, `rhash_entries` is now equal to 1,048,576 but
`net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity` has been set to 2. Therefore, the
aggressive part of the garbage collectors kicks at the same threshold
than for the previous plot. However, its goal is now four times larger
and the oscillations have a larger amplitude. The fact that the
aggressive part of the garbage collector kicks less often is nullified
by the fact that it needs to remove more entries each time. Because of
the slight impact on cache efficiency, it seems better to keep
`net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity` around 8, or 4 if we want to keep
shorter chains (but there seems to be no improvement to do so).

The other plots show what happens when there is a sudden surge in the
number of routes added or when there is a pause.

## Meeting the goal

Now that we understand how `rhash_entries`,
`net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity` and `net.ipv4.route.gc_threshold`
interact, let's look at `net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout`. Once the garbage
collector has set its goal and if it is positive, it needs to choose
which entries to remove from the cache.

It walks the hash table from the position of its last run and remove
entries until its goal is met. If the entry is not current anymore
(for example, the network interface associated to it has changed its
IP configuration), it is removed. Otherwise, the system looks at the
age of the entry and its position in the chain. If the entry is the
first in the chain, it is kept only if its age is below
`net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout`. If it is second, it is kept only if its
age is below half of `net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout`. If it is third, the
threshold is a quarter of `net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout`, and so on. The
garbage collector will favor short chains.

If after a full run of the hash table, the garbage collector was not
able to meet its goal, it will start again but will behave more
aggressively, as if `net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout` is set to half of its
value. It will do as many passes as necessary until its goal is met or
until there is no way to remove any entry (or until it has spent too
much time). Once the garbage collector has switched to this more
aggressive behavior, it will keep being aggressive for a few cycles
(a bit less for each cycle).

With a very large value of `net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout`, the garbage
collector will have a hard time to find entries to expire. It will
need to do several passes until it is able to expire some entries. On
the other hand, if you choose a very small value, the garbage
collector may remove entries that were just added, even if there are
older entries further in the hash table.

For a more in-depth coverage of how the route cache works, look at
chapter 33 of
*[Understanding Linux Network Internals][understanding]*. Just be
aware that multipath route caching has been removed (and was never
really used) and asynchronous cleanup (`rt_periodic_timer`) does not
exist anymore.

**UPDATED:** As stated earlier, `net.ipv4.route.gc_interval` has been
[reinstantiated in Linux 3.2][gcinterval2]. The cleanup is a bit
different of what is done by the garbage collector but have some
similarities. It is run every `net.ipv4.route.gc_interval` seconds
(even when there is less than `net.ipv4.route.gc_threshold`
entries). It will set a goal proportional to
`net.ipv4.route.gc_interval` and inversely proportional to
`net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout`. It cannot be greater than
`rhash_entries`. If `net.ipv4.route.gc_interval` and
`net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout` are equal, the goal is exactly
`rhash_entries`. It represents the number of entries the cleanup
procedure will look at (and *not* the number of entries it will try to
expire). If an entry is not valid anymore or is old enough to be
removed (with the same criteria as for the garbage collector), it will
be removed. Another important thing about this cleanup algorithm is
that it will modify the maximum allowed length of a chain to the
average length it has observed plus four times the standard deviation
with a maximum equal to `net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity`. Without this
algorithm, the maximum allowed length is 20. When inserting a new
entry, if a chain with more than `net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity`
entries is selected, the kernel will try to remove an element before
inserting a new one. Then, if the chain is still longer than the
maximum allowed length (longer than what is allowed by
`net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity` or too long compared to other
chains[^attack]), all cache entries for the current interface are
invalidated.

[^attack]: This allows the kernel to guard against collision attacks.

# Conclusion

When tuning the route cache, `rhash_entries`,
`net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity`, `net.ipv4.route.max_size` and
`net.ipv4.route.gc_threshold` are related and should not be modified
independently. `net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh` should be below the product
of `net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity` and `rhash_entries` while
`net.ipv4.route.max_size` should be above this value.

Linux exposes several interesting metrics related to the route
cache. Monitoring them allows one to watch the efficiency of the
route cache and may uncover some anomalies (garbage collector
running too often, difficulty to remove routes from the cache, ...).

The route cache subsystem still evolves and some old behaviors have
been dismissed. The best documentation is, unfortunately, still the
code and other documentations tend to become obsolete. The IPv6
route cache is quite different of the one presented here. Don't
blindly apply the same tuning for IPv6.
