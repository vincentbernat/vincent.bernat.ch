An increasingly popular design for a datacenter network is **BGP on
the host**: each host ships with a BGP daemon to advertise the IPs it
handles and receives the routes to its fellow servers. Compared to a
L2-based design, it is very scalable, resilient, cross-vendor and safe
to operate.[^easy] Take a look at "[L3 routing to the hypervisor with
BGP][]" for a usage example.

[^easy]: Notably, the data flow and the control plane are separated. A
    node can remove itself by notifying its peers without losing a
    single packet.

![Spine-leaf fabric two spine routers, six leaf routers and nine
physical hosts. All links have a BGP session established over them.
Some of the servers have a speech balloon expliciting the IP prefix
they want to handle.]([[!!images/bgp-on-the-host.svg]] "BGP on the
host with a spine-leaf IP fabric. A BGP session is established over
each link and each host advertises its own IP prefixes.")

While routing on the host eliminates the security problems related to
Ethernet networks, a server may announce any IP prefix. In the above
picture, two of them are announcing `2001:db8:cc::/64`. This could be
a legit use of anycast or a prefix hijack. BGP offers several
solutions to improve this aspect and one of them is to reuse the
features around the RPKI.

# Short introduction to the RPKI

On the Internet, BGP is mostly relying on trust. This contributes to
various incidents due to operator errors, like the one that [affected
Cloudflare a few months ago][], or to malicious attackers, like the
[hijack of Amazon DNS to steal cryptocurrency wallets][]. [RFC 7454][]
explains the best practices to avoid such issues.

IP addresses are allocated by five Regional Internet Registries (RIR).
Each of them maintains a database of the assigned Internet resources,
notably the IP addresses and the associated AS numbers. These
databases may not be entirely reliable but are widely used to build
ACLs to ensure peers only announce the prefixes they are expected to.
Here is an example of ACLs generated by [bgpq3][] when peering
directly with Apple:[^asset]

    ::console
    $ bgpq3 -l v6-IMPORT-APPLE -6 -R 48 -m 48 -A -J -E AS-APPLE
    policy-options {
     policy-statement v6-IMPORT-APPLE {
    replace:
      from {
        route-filter 2403:300::/32 upto /48;
        route-filter 2620:0:1b00::/47 prefix-length-range /48-/48;
        route-filter 2620:0:1b02::/48 exact;
        route-filter 2620:0:1b04::/47 prefix-length-range /48-/48;
        route-filter 2620:149::/32 upto /48;
        route-filter 2a01:b740::/32 upto /48;
        route-filter 2a01:b747::/32 upto /48;
      }
     }
    }

[^asset]: People often use AS sets, like `AS-APPLE` in this example,
    as they are convenient if you have multiple AS numbers or
    customers. However, there is currently nothing preventing a rogue
    actor to add arbitrary AS numbers to their AS set.

The RPKI ([RFC 6480][]) adds public-key cryptography on top of it to
sign the authorization for an AS to be the *origin* of an IP prefix.
Such record is a *Route Origination Authorization* (ROA). You can
browse the databases of these ROAs through the [RIPE's RPKI Validator
instance][]:

![Screenshot from an instance of RPKI validator showing the validity
of 85.190.88.0/21 for AS 64476]([[!!images/rpki-validator@2x.png]]
"RPKI validator shows one ROA for 85.190.88.0/21")

BGP daemons do not have to download the databases or to check digital
signatures to validate the received prefixes. Instead, they offload
these tasks to a local RPKI validator implementing the
"*RPKI-to-Router Protocol*" (RTR, [RFC 6810][]).

For more details, have a look at "[RPKI and BGP: our path to securing
Internet Routing][]."

# Using origin validation in the datacenter

While it is possible to create our own RPKI for use inside the
datacenter, we can take a shortcut and use a validator implementing
RTR, like [GoRTR][], and accepting another source of truth. Let's work
on the following topology:

![Spine-leaf fabric two spine routers, six leaf routers and nine
physical hosts. All links have a BGP session established over them.
Three of the physical hosts are validators and RTR sessions are
established between them and the top-of-the-rack routers—except their
own top-of-the-racks.]([[!!images/rpki-datacenter.svg]] "BGP on the
host with prefix validation using RTR. Each server has its own AS
number. The leaf routers establish RTR sessions to the validators.")

You assume we have a place to maintain a mapping between the private
AS numbers used by each host and the allowed prefixes:[^asn]

| ASN      | Allowed prefixes                          |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| AS 65005 | `2001:db8:aa::/64`                        |
| AS 65006 | `2001:db8:bb::/64`,<br>`2001:db8:11::/64` |
| AS 65007 | `2001:db8:cc::/64`                        |
| AS 65008 | `2001:db8:dd::/64`                        |
| AS 65009 | `2001:db8:ee::/64`,<br>`2001:db8:11::/64` |
| AS 65010 | `2001:db8:ff::/64`                        |

[^asn]: We are using 16-bit AS numbers for readability. Because we
    need to assign a different AS number for each host in the
    datacenter, in an actual deployment, we would use 32-bit AS
    numbers.

From this table, we build a JSON file for *GoRTR*, assuming each host
can announce the provided prefixes or longer ones (like
`2001:db8:aa::­42:d9ff:­fefc:287a/128` for AS 65005):

    ::json
    {
      "roas": [
        {
          "prefix": "2001:db8:aa::/64",
          "maxLength": 128,
          "asn": "AS65005"
        }, {
          "…": "…"
        }, {
          "prefix": "2001:db8:ff::/64",
          "maxLength": 128,
          "asn": "AS65010"
        }, {
          "prefix": "2001:db8:11::/64",
          "maxLength": 128,
          "asn": "AS65006"
        }, {
          "prefix": "2001:db8:11::/64",
          "maxLength": 128,
          "asn": "AS65009"
        }
      ]
    }

This file is deployed to all validators and served by a web server.
*GoRTR* is configured to fetch it and update it every 10 minutes:

    ::console
    $ gortr -refresh=600 \
            -verify=false -checktime=false \
            -cache=http://127.0.0.1/rpki.json
    INFO[0000] New update (7 uniques, 8 total prefixes). 0 bytes. Updating sha256 hash  -> 68a1d3b52db8d654bd8263788319f08e3f5384ae54064a7034e9dbaee236ce96
    INFO[0000] Updated added, new serial 1

The refresh time could be lowered but *GoRTR* can be notified of an
update using the `SIGHUP` signal. Clients are immediately notified of
the change.

The next step is to configure the leaf routers to validate the
received prefixes using the farm of validators. Most vendors support
RTR:

| Platform          | Over TCP? | Over SSH? |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| [Juniper JunOS][] | ✔️         | ❌        |
| [Cisco IOS XR][]  | ✔️         | ✔️         |
| [Cisco IOS XE][]  | ✔️         | ❌        |
| [Cisco IOS][]     | ✔️         | ❌        |
| [Arista EOS][]    | ✔️         | ❌        |
| [BIRD][]          | ✔️         | ✔️         |
| [FRR][]           | ✔️         | ✔️         |
| [GoBGP][]         | ✔️         | ❌        |

## Configuring JunOS

*JunOS* only supports plain-text TCP. First, let's configure the
connections to the validation servers:

    ::junos
    routing-options {
        validation {
            group RPKI {
                session validator1 {
                    hold-time 60;         # session is considered down after 1 minute
                    record-lifetime 3600; # cache is kept for 1 hour
                    refresh-time 30;      # cache is refreshed every 30 seconds
                    port 8282;
                }
                session validator2 { /* OMITTED */ }
                session validator3 { /* OMITTED */ }
            }
        }
    }

By default, at most two sessions are randomly established at the same
time. This provides a good way to load-balance them among the
validators while maintaining good availability. The second step is to
define the policy for route validation:

    ::junos
    policy-options {
        policy-statement ACCEPT-VALID {
            term valid {
                from {
                    protocol bgp;
                    validation-database valid;
                }
                then {
                    validation-state valid;
                    accept;
                }
            }
            term invalid {
                from {
                    protocol bgp;
                    validation-database invalid;
                }
                then {
                    validation-state invalid;
                    reject;
                }
            }
        }
        policy-statement REJECT-ALL {
            then reject;
        }
    }

The policy statement `ACCEPT-VALID` turns the validation state of a
prefix from `unknown` to `valid` if the ROA database says it is valid.
It also accepts the route. If the prefix is invalid, the prefix is
marked as such and rejected. We have also prepared a `REJECT-ALL`
statement to reject everything else, notably unknown prefixes.

A ROA only certifies the **origin** of a prefix. A malicious actor can
therefore prepend the expected AS number to the AS path to circumvent
the validation. For example, AS 65007 could annonce
`2001:db8:dd::/64`, a prefix allocated to AS 65006, by advertising it
with the AS path `65007 65006`. To avoid that, we define an additional
policy statement to reject AS paths with more than one ASN:[^oneas]

    ::junos
    policy-options {
        as-path EXACTLY-ONE-ASN "^.$";
        policy-statement ONLY-DIRECTLY-CONNECTED {
            term exactly-one-asn {
                from {
                    protocol bgp;
                    as-path EXACTLY-ONE-ASN;
                }
                then next policy;
            }
            then reject;
        }
    }

[^oneas]: This restriction also prevents the peer from prepending its
    own ASN to deprioritize a path. A modern alternative is to use the
    [graceful shutdown community][].

The last step is to configure the BGP sessions:

    ::junos hl_lines="7 8"
    protocols {
        bgp {
            group HOSTS {
                local-as 65100;
                type external;
                # export [ … ];
                import [ ONLY-DIRECTLY-CONNECTED ACCEPT-VALID REJECT-ALL ];
                enforce-first-as;
                neighbor 2001:db8:42::a10 {
                    peer-as 65005;
                }
                neighbor 2001:db8:42::a12 {
                    peer-as 65006;
                }
                neighbor 2001:db8:42::a14 {
                    peer-as 65007;
                }
            }
        }
    }

The import policy rejects any AS path longer than one AS, accepts any
validated prefix and rejects everything else. The `enforce-first-as`
directive is also pretty important: it ensures the first (and, here,
only) AS in the AS path matches the peer AS. Without it, a malicious
neighbor could inject a prefix using an AS different than its own,
defeating our purpose.[^enforce]

[^enforce]: Cisco routers and FRR enforce the first AS by default. It
    is a tunable value to allow the use of route servers: they
    distribute prefixes on behalf of other routers.

Let's check the state of the RTR sessions and the database:

    ::console
    > show validation session
    Session                                  State   Flaps     Uptime #IPv4/IPv6 records

    2001:db8:4242::11                        Up          0   00:16:07 0/9
    2001:db8:4242::12                        Connect     0            0/0

    2001:db8:11::/64-128       65009 2001:db8:4242::11                       valid
    2001:db8:aa::/64-128       65005 2001:db8:4242::10                       valid

    2001:db8:bb::/64-128       65006 2001:db8:4242::10                       valid
    2001:db8:bb::/64-128       65006 2001:db8:4242::11                       valid

    2001:db8:ee::/64-128       65009 2001:db8:4242::10                       valid
    2001:db8:ee::/64-128       65009 2001:db8:4242::11                       valid

      IPv4 records: 0
      IPv6 records: 18

Here is an example of accepted route:

    ::console hl_lines="14"
    > show route protocol bgp table inet6 extensive all
    inet6.0: 11 destinations, 11 routes (8 active, 0 holddown, 3 hidden)
    2001:db8:bb::42/128 (1 entry, 0 announced)
            *BGP    Preference: 170/-101

                    Next-hop reference count: 4

                    Localpref: 100
                    Router ID: 1.1.1.1

A rejected route would be similar with the reason "rejected by import
policy" shown in the details and the validation state would be
`invalid`.

## Configuring BIRD

*BIRD* supports both plain-text TCP and SSH. Let's configure it to use
SSH. We need to generate keypairs for both the leaf router and the
validators (they can all share the same keypair). We also have to
create a `known_hosts` file for *BIRD*:

    ::console
    (validatorX)$ ssh-keygen -qN "" -t rsa -f /etc/gortr/ssh_key
    (validatorX)$ echo -n "validatorX:8283 " ; \
                  cat /etc/bird/ssh_key_rtr.pub
    validatorX:8283 ssh-rsa AAAAB3[…]Rk5TW0=
    (leaf1)$ ssh-keygen -qN "" -t rsa -f /etc/bird/ssh_key
    (leaf1)$ echo 'validator1:8283 ssh-rsa AAAAB3[…]Rk5TW0=' >> /etc/bird/known_hosts
    (leaf1)$ echo 'validator2:8283 ssh-rsa AAAAB3[…]Rk5TW0=' >> /etc/bird/known_hosts
    (leaf1)$ cat /etc/bird/ssh_key.pub
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3[…]byQ7s=
    (validatorX)$ echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3[…]byQ7s=' >> /etc/gortr/authorized_keys

*GoRTR* needs additional flags to allow connections over SSH:

    ::console
    $ gortr -refresh=600 -verify=false -checktime=false \
          -cache=http://127.0.0.1/rpki.json \
          -ssh.bind=:8283 \
          -ssh.key=/etc/gortr/ssh_key \
          -ssh.method.key=true \
          -ssh.auth.user=rpki \
          -ssh.auth.key.file=/etc/gortr/authorized_keys
    INFO[0000] Enabling ssh with the following authentications: password=false, key=true
    INFO[0000] New update (7 uniques, 8 total prefixes). 0 bytes. Updating sha256 hash  -> 68a1d3b52db8d654bd8263788319f08e3f5384ae54064a7034e9dbaee236ce96
    INFO[0000] Updated added, new serial 1

Then, we can configure *BIRD* to use these RTR servers:

    ::junos
    roa6 table ROA6;
    template rpki VALIDATOR {
       roa6 { table ROA6; };
       transport ssh {
         user "rpki";

    protocol rpki VALIDATOR2 from VALIDATOR {
       remote validator2 port 8283;
    }

Unlike *JunOS*, *BIRD* doesn't have a feature to only use a subset of
validators. Therefore, we only configure two of them. As a safety
measure, if both connections become unavailable, *BIRD* will keep the
ROAs for one hour.

We can query the state of the RTR sessions and the database:

    ::console

Like for the *JunOS* case, a malicious actor could try to workaround
the validation by building an AS path where the last AS number is the
legitimate one. *BIRD* is flexible enough to allow us to use any AS to
check the IP prefix. Instead of checking the origin AS, we ask it to
check the peer AS with this function, without looking at the AS path:

    ::junos hl_lines="2"
    function validated(int peeras) {
       if (roa_check(ROA6, net, peeras) != ROA_VALID) then {
          print "Ignore invalid ROA ", net, " for ASN ", peeras;
          reject;
       }
       accept;
    }

The BGP instance is then configured to use the above function as the
import policy:

    ::junos hl_lines="7"
    protocol bgp PEER1 {
       local as 65100;
       neighbor 2001:db8:42::a10 as 65005;
       connect delay time 30;
       ipv6 {
          import keep filtered;
          import where validated(65005);
          # export …;
       };
    }

You can view the rejected routes with `show route filtered`, but
*BIRD* does not store information about the validation state in the
routes. You can also watch the logs:

    2019-07-31 17:29:08.491 <INFO> Ignore invalid ROA 2001:db8:bb::40:/126 for ASN 65005

Currently, *BIRD* does not reevaluate the prefixes when the ROAs are
updated. There is [work in progress to fix this][]. If this feature is
important to you, have a look at [FRR][] instead: it also supports the
RTR protocol and triggers a soft reconfiguration of the BGP sessions
when ROAs are updated.

!!! "Update (2019-11)" There is another drawback of BIRD's
implementation: if the ROAs are not loaded before the BGP connection
is established, some routes may be rejected because they are unknown.
This is the reason there is a `connect delay time` directive in the
proposed configuration.
