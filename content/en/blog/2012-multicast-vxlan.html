_Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network_ (VXLAN) is a protocol to
overlay a virtualized L2 network over an existing IP network with
little setup. It is currently described in an
[Internet-Draft][VXLAN-draft]. It adds the following perks to VLANs
while still providing isolation:

 1. It uses a 24-bit _VXLAN Network Identifier_ (VNI) which should be
    enough to address any scale-based concerns of multitenancy.
 2. It wraps L2 frames into UDP datagrams. This allows one to rely on
    some interesting properties of IP networks like availability and
    scalability. A VXLAN segment can be extended far beyond the
    typical reach of today VLANs.

The _VXLAN Tunnel End Point_ (VTEP) originates and terminates VXLAN
tunnels. Thanks to a serie of patches from Stephen Hemminger,
[Linux can now act as a VTEP][linux]. Let's see how this works.

# About IPv6

When possible, I try to use IPv6 for my labs. This is not the case
here for several reasons:

 1. IP multicast is required and PIM-SM implementations for IPv6 are
    not widespread yet. However, they exist. This explains why I use
    [XORP][] for this lab: it supports PIM-SM for both IPv4 and IPv6.
 2. [VXLAN Internet-Draft][VXLAN-draft] specifically addresses only
    IPv4. This seems a bit odd for a protocol running on top of UDP
    and I hope this will be fixed soon. This is not a major
    stopper since
    [some VXLAN implementations support IPv6][upa-vxlan].
 3. However, the current implementation for Linux does not support
    IPv6. IPv6 support will be [added later][vxlan-ipv6].

Once IPv6 support is available, the lab should be easy to adapt.

**UPDATED:** The [latest draft][] addresses IPv6 support. It is
available in Linux 3.11.

# Lab

So, here is the lab used. `R1`, `R2` and `R3` will act as VTEPs. They
do not make use of PIM-SM. Instead, they have a generic multicast route
on `eth0`. `E1`, `E2` and `E3` are edge routers while `C1`, `C2` and
`C3` are core routers. The proposed lab is not resilient but
convenient to explain how things work. It is built on top of KVM
hosts. Have a look at my [previous article][] for more details on
this.

![VXLAN lab][1]

The lab is hosted on [GitHub][]. I have made the lab easier to try by
including the kernel I have used for my tests. XORP comes
preconfigured, you just have to configure the VXLAN part. For this,
you need a recent version of `ip`.

    ::console
    $ sudo apt-get install screen vde2 kvm iproute xorp git
    $ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git
    $ cd iproute2
    $ ./configure && make
    You get `ip' as `ip/ip' and `bridge' as `bridge/bridge'.
    $ cd ..
    $ git clone git://github.com/vincentbernat/network-lab.git
    $ cd network-lab/lab-vxlan
    $ ./setup

## Unicast routing

The first step is to setup unicast routing. OSPF is used for this
purpose. The chosen routing daemon is [XORP][]. With `xorpsh`, we can
check if OSPF is working as expected:

    ::console
    root@c1# xorpsh
    root@c1$ show ospf4 neighbor   
      Address         Interface             State      ID              Pri  Dead
    192.168.11.11    eth0/eth0              Full      3.0.0.1          128    36
    192.168.12.22    eth1/eth1              Full      3.0.0.2          128    33
    192.168.101.133  eth2/eth2              Full      2.0.0.3          128    36
    192.168.102.122  eth3/eth3              Full      2.0.0.2          128    38
    root@c1$ show route table ipv4 unicast ospf   
    192.168.1.0/24  [ospf(110)/2]
                    > to 192.168.11.11 via eth0/eth0
    192.168.2.0/24  [ospf(110)/2]
                    > to 192.168.12.22 via eth1/eth1
    192.168.3.0/24  [ospf(110)/3]
                    > to 192.168.102.122 via eth3/eth3
    192.168.13.0/24 [ospf(110)/2]
                    > to 192.168.102.122 via eth3/eth3
    192.168.21.0/24 [ospf(110)/2]
                    > to 192.168.101.133 via eth2/eth2
    192.168.22.0/24 [ospf(110)/2]
                    > to 192.168.12.22 via eth1/eth1
    192.168.23.0/24 [ospf(110)/2]
                    > to 192.168.101.133 via eth2/eth2
    192.168.103.0/24        [ospf(110)/2]
                    > to 192.168.102.122 via eth3/eth3

## Multicast routing

Once unicast routing is up and running, we need to setup multicast
routing. There are two protocols for this: _IGMP_ and _PIM-SM_. The
former one allows routers to forward multicast datagrams while the
first one allows hosts to subscribe to a multicast group.

### IGMP

IGMP is used by hosts and adjacent routers to establish multicast
group membership. In our case, it will be used by `R2` to let `E2`
know it subscribed to `239.0.0.11` (a multicast group).

Configuring XORP to support IGMP is simple. Let's test with `iperf` to
have a multicast listener on `R2`:

    ::console
    root@r2# iperf -u -s -l 1000 -i 1 -B 239.0.0.11
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Server listening on UDP port 5001
    Binding to local address 239.0.0.11
    Joining multicast group  239.0.0.11
    Receiving 1000 byte datagrams
    UDP buffer size:  208 KByte (default)
    ------------------------------------------------------------

On `E2`, we can now check that `R2` is properly registered for
`239.0.0.11`:

    ::console
    root@e2$ show igmp group
    Interface    Group           Source          LastReported Timeout V State
    eth0         239.0.0.11      0.0.0.0         192.168.2.2      248 2     E

XORP documentation contains a [good overview of IGMP][xorp-igmp].

### PIM-SM

PIM-SM is far more complex. It does not have its own topology
discovery protocol and relies on routing information from other
protocols, OSPF in our case.

I will describe here a simplified view on how PIM-SM works. XORP
documentation contains [more details about PIM-SM][xorp-pimsm].

The first step for all PIM-SM routers is to **elect a rendez-vous
point** (RP). In our lab, only `C1`, `C2` and `C3` have been
configured to be elected as a RP. Moreover, we give better priority to
`C3` to ensure it wins.

![RP election][2]
[2]: [[!!images/vxlan/multicast-rp.png]] "C3 has been elected as RP"

    ::console
    root@e1$ show pim rps   
    RP              Type      Pri Holdtime Timeout ActiveGroups GroupPrefix       
    192.168.101.133 bootstrap 100      150     135            0 239.0.0.0/8       

Let's suppose we start `iperf` on both `R2` and `R3`. Using IGMP, they
subscribe to multicast group `239.0.0.11` with `E2` and `E3`
respectively. Then, `E2` and `E3` send a join message (also known as a
_(*,G) join_) to the RP (`C3`) for that multicast group. Using the
unicast path from `E2` and `E3` to the RP, the **routers along the
paths build the RP tree (RPT)**, rooted at `C3`.  Each router in the
tree knows how to send multicast packets to `239.0.0.11`: it will send
them to the leaves.

![RP tree][3]
[3]: [[!!images/vxlan/multicast-rptree.png]] "RP tree for 239.0.0.11 has been built"

    ::console
    root@e3$ show pim join   
    Group           Source          RP              Flags
    239.0.0.11      0.0.0.0         192.168.101.133 WC

Let's suppose that `R1` wants to send multicast packets to
`239.0.0.11`. It sends them to `R1` which does not have any
information on how to contact all the members of the multicast group
because it is not the RP. Therefore, it **encapsulates the multicast
packets into PIM Register packets** and sends them to the RP. The RP
decapsulates them and sends them natively. The multicast packets are
routed from the RP to `R2` and `R3` using the reverse path formed by
the join messages.

![Multicast routing via the RP][4]
[4]: [[!!images/vxlan/multicast-register.png]] "R1 sends multicast packets to 239.0.0.11 via the RP"

    ::console

As presented here, the routing is not optimal: packets from `R1` to
`R2` could avoid the RP. Moreover, encapsulating multicast packets
into unicast packets is not efficient either. At some point, the RP
will decide to switch to native multicast[^native]. Rooted at `R1`,
**the shortest-path tree (SPT) for the multicast group will be built
using source-specific join messages** (also known as a _(S,G) join_).

[^native]: The decision is usually done when the bandwidth used by the
           follow reachs some threshold. With XORP, this can be
           controlled with `switch-to-spt-threshold`. However, I was
           unable to make this works as expected. XORP never sends the
           appropriate PIM packets to make the switch. Therefore, for
           this lab, it has been configured to switch to native
           multicast at the first received packet.

![Multicast routing without RP][5]
[5]: [[!!images/vxlan/multicast-native.png]] "R1 sends multicast packets to 239.0.0.11 using native multicast following the shortest-path tree"

From here, each router in the tree knows how to handle multicast
packets from `R1` to the group without involving the RP. For example,
`E1` knows it must duplicate the packet and sends one through the
interface to `C3` and the other one through the interface to `C1`:

    ::console
    root@e1$ show pim join

## Setting up VXLAN

Once IP multicast is running, setting up VXLAN is quite easy. Here are the software requirements:

 - A recent kernel. Pick at least 3.7-rc3. You need to enable
   `CONFIG_VXLAN` option. You also currently need a patch on top of it
   to be able to [specify a TTL greater than 1][vxlan-ttl] for
   multicast packets.
 - A recent version of `ip`. Currently, you need the version from _git_.

On `R1`, `R2` and `R3`, we create a `vxlan42` interface with the following commands:

    ::console
    root@rX# ./ip link add vxlan42 type vxlan id 42 \
    >                               group 239.0.0.42 \
    >                               ttl 10 dev eth0
    root@rX# ip link set up dev vxlan42
    root@rX# ./ip -d link show vxlan42
    10: vxlan42: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1460 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT 
    link/ether 3e:09:1c:e1:09:2e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    vxlan id 42 group 239.0.0.42 dev eth0 port 32768 61000 ttl 10 ageing 300 

Let's assign an IP in `192.168.99.0/24` for each router and check they can ping each other:

    ::console
    root@r1# ip addr add 192.168.99.1/24 dev vxlan42
    root@r2# ip addr add 192.168.99.2/24 dev vxlan42
    root@r3# ip addr add 192.168.99.3/24 dev vxlan42
    root@r1# ping 192.168.99.2                    
    PING 192.168.99.2 (192.168.99.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.99.2: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=3.90 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.99.2: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=1.38 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.99.2: icmp_req=3 ttl=64 time=1.82 ms

    --- 192.168.99.2 ping statistics ---
    3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2003ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.389/2.375/3.907/1.098 ms

We can check the packets are encapsulated:

    ::console
    root@r1# tcpdump -pni eth0
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
    listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
    11:30:36.561185 IP 192.168.1.1.43349 > 192.168.2.2.8472: UDP, length 106
    11:30:36.563179 IP 192.168.2.2.33894 > 192.168.1.1.8472: UDP, length 106
    11:30:37.562677 IP 192.168.1.1.43349 > 192.168.2.2.8472: UDP, length 106
    11:30:37.564316 IP 192.168.2.2.33894 > 192.168.1.1.8472: UDP, length 106

Moreover, if we send broadcast packets (with `ping -b` or ARP
requests), they are encapsulated into multicast packets:

    ::console
    root@r1# tcpdump -pni eth0
    11:31:27.464198 IP 192.168.1.1.41958 > 239.0.0.42.8472: UDP, length 106
    11:31:28.463584 IP 192.168.1.1.41958 > 239.0.0.42.8472: UDP, length 106

Recent versions of `iproute` also comes with `bridge`, an utility
allowing one to inspect the FDB of bridge-like interfaces:

    ::console
    root@r1# ../bridge/bridge fdb show vxlan42
    3e:09:1c:e1:09:2e dev vxlan42 dst 192.168.2.2 self 
    0e:98:40:c6:58:10 dev vxlan42 dst 192.168.3.3 self
