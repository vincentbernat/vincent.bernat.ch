!!! "TL;DR" With its implementation of IPv4 routing tables using
LPC-tries, Linux offers good lookup performance (50 ns for a full
view) and low memory usage (64 MiB for a full view).

During the lifetime of an IPv4 datagram inside the Linux kernel, one
important step is the **route lookup for the destination address**
through the [`fib_lookup()`][fib_lookup()] function. From essential
information about the datagram (source and destination IP addresses,
interfaces, firewall mark, ...), this function should quickly provide
a decision. Some possible options are:

 - local delivery (`RTN_LOCAL`),
 - forwarding to a supplied next hop (`RTN_UNICAST`),
 - silent discard (`RTN_BLACKHOLE`).

Since 2.6.39, Linux stores routes in a **compressed prefix tree**
([commit 3630b7c050d9][]). In the past, a [route cache][] was
maintained but it has been [removed][route cache removed][^why] in
Linux 3.6.

[^why]: The routing cache was subject to reasonably easy to launch
    denial of service attacks. It was also believed to not be
    efficient for high volume sites like Google but I have first-hand
    experience it was not the case for moderately high volume sites.

# Route lookup in a trie

Looking up a route in a routing table is to find the **most specific
prefix** matching the requested destination. Let's assume the
following routing table:

    ::console
    $ ip route show scope global table 100
    default via 203.0.113.5 dev out2
    192.0.2.0/25
            nexthop via 203.0.113.7  dev out3 weight 1
            nexthop via 203.0.113.9  dev out4 weight 1
    192.0.2.47 via 203.0.113.3 dev out1
    192.0.2.48 via 203.0.113.3 dev out1
    192.0.2.49 via 203.0.113.3 dev out1
    192.0.2.50 via 203.0.113.3 dev out1

Here are some examples of lookups and the associated results:

Destination IP   | Next hop
---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------
`192.0.2.49`     | `203.0.113.3` via `out1`
`192.0.2.50`     | `203.0.113.3` via `out1`
`192.0.2.51`     | `203.0.113.7` via `out3` or `203.0.113.9` via `out4` (ECMP)
`192.0.2.200`    | `203.0.113.5` via `out2`

A common structure for route lookup is the [trie][], a tree structure
where each node has its parent as prefix.

## Lookup with a simple trie

The following trie encodes the previous routing table:

![Simple routing trie][i10]
[i10]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-simple-trie-v3.svg]] "Simple routing trie for a small routing table. For readibility, the trie has been cut in two parts. The nodes with an arrow contain an actual route entry."

For each node, the prefix is known by its path from the root node and
the prefix length is the current depth.

A lookup in such a trie is quite simple: at each step, fetch the
*n*<sup>th</sup> bit of the IP address, where *n* is the current
depth. If it is 0, continue with the first child. Otherwise, continue
with the second. If a child is missing, backtrack until a routing
entry is found.  For example, when looking for `192.0.2.50`, we will
find the result in the corresponding leaf (at depth 32). However for
`192.0.2.51`, we will reach `192.0.2.50/31` but there is no second
child. Therefore, we backtrack until the `192.0.2.0/25` routing entry.

Adding and removing routes is quite easy. From a performance point of
view, the lookup is done in constant time relative to the number of
routes (due to maximum depth being capped to 32).

[Quagga][trie-quagga] is an example of routing software still using
this simple approach.

## Lookup with a path-compressed trie

In the previous example, most nodes only have one child. This leads to
a lot of unneeded bitwise comparisons and memory is also wasted on
many nodes. To overcome this problem, we can use **path compression**:
each node with only one child is removed (except if it also contains a
routing entry). Each remaining node gets a new property telling how
many input bits should be skipped. Such a trie is also known as a
*Patricia trie* or a [radix tree][]. Here is the path-compressed
version of the previous trie:

![Patricia trie][i11]
[i11]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-patricia-trie-v3.svg]] "Patricia trie for a small routing table. Some nodes indicate how many additional input bits to skip."

Since some bits have been ignored, on a match, a final check is
executed to ensure all bits from the found entry are matching the
input IP address. If not, we must act as if the entry wasn't found
(and backtrack to find a matching prefix). The following figure shows
two IP addresses matching the same leaf:

![Lookup in a Patricia trie][i12]
[i12]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-patricia-trie-lookup-v3.svg]] "Lookup of two IP addresses in a Patricia trie. Both IP share the same checked bits but differ on the skipped ones."

The reduction on the average depth of the tree compensates the
necessity to handle these false positives. The insertion and deletion
of a routing entry is still easy enough.

Many routing systems are using Patricia trees:

 - [OpenBSD][patricia-openbsd]
 - [NetBSD][patricia-netbsd]
 - [FreeBSD][patricia-freebsd]
 - [GoBGP][] (through [go-radix][])
 - Linux for [IPv6][patricia-linux], see “[IPv6 route lookup on Linux][]”

## Lookup with a level-compressed trie

In addition to path compression, **level compression**[^ref-lpc]
detects parts of the trie that are **densily populated** and replace
them with a single node and an associated vector of 2<sup>*k*</sup>
children. This node will handle *k* input bits instead of just
one. For example, here is a level-compressed version our previous
trie:

![Level-compressed trie][i13]
[i13]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-lpc-trie-v3.svg]] "LPC trie. Two levels are merged into a single one using a 4-element vector. The last element of this vector is empty."

[^ref-lpc]: “[IP-address lookup using LC-tries][lpc-trie],” IEEE
    Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 17(6):1083-1092, June
    1999.

Such a trie is called LC-trie or **LPC-trie** and offers higher lookup
performance compared to a radix tree.

An heuristic is used to decide how many bits a node should handle. On
Linux, if the ratio of non-empty children to all children would be
above 50% when the node handles an additional bit, the node gets this
additional bit. On the other hand, if the current ratio is below 25%,
the node loses the responsibility of one bit. These values are not
tunable.

Insertion and deletion becomes more complex but lookup times are
also improved.

# Implementation in Linux

The implementation for IPv4 in Linux exists since 2.6.13
([commit 19baf839ff4a][]) and is enabled by default since 2.6.39
([commit 3630b7c050d9][]).

Here is the representation of our example routing table in memory:[^tnode]

![Memory representation of a trie][i14]
[i14]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-struct-v3.svg]] "In-memory representation of an LPC trie in Linux"

[^tnode]: For internal nodes, the `key_vector` structure is embedded
    into a `tnode` structure. This structure contains information
    rarely used during lookup, notably the reference to the parent
    that is usually not needed for backtracking as Linux keeps the
    nearest candidate in a variable.

There are several structures involved:

 - [`struct fib_table`][struct fib_table] represents a routing table,
 - [`struct trie`][struct trie] represents a complete trie,
 - [`struct key_vector`][struct key_vector] represents either
   an internal node (when `bits` is not zero) or a leaf,
 - [`struct fib_info`][struct fib_info] contains the characteristics
   shared by several routes (like a next-hop gateway and an output
   interface),
 - [`struct fib_alias`][struct fib_alias] is the glue between the
   leaves and the `fib_info` structures.

The trie can be retrieved through `/proc/net/fib_trie`:

    ::console
    $ cat /proc/net/fib_trie
    Id 100:
      +-- 0.0.0.0/0 2 0 2
         |-- 0.0.0.0
            /0 universe UNICAST
         +-- 192.0.2.0/26 2 0 1
            |-- 192.0.2.0
               /25 universe UNICAST
            |-- 192.0.2.47
               /32 universe UNICAST
            +-- 192.0.2.48/30 2 0 1
               |-- 192.0.2.48
                  /32 universe UNICAST
               |-- 192.0.2.49
                  /32 universe UNICAST
               |-- 192.0.2.50
                  /32 universe UNICAST
    [...]

For internal nodes, the numbers after the prefix are:

 1. the number of bits handled by the node,
 2. the number of full children (they only handle one bit),
 3. the number of empty children.

Moreover, if the kernel was compiled with `CONFIG_IP_FIB_TRIE_STATS`,
some interesting statistics are available in `/proc/net/fib_triestat`:[^stats]

    ::console
    $ cat /proc/net/fib_triestat
    Basic info: size of leaf: 48 bytes, size of tnode: 40 bytes.
    Id 100:
            Aver depth:     2.33
            Max depth:      3
            Leaves:         6
            Prefixes:       6
            Internal nodes: 3
              2: 3
            Pointers: 12
    Null ptrs: 4
    Total size: 1  kB
    [...]

[^stats]: One leaf can contain several routes (`struct fib_alias` is a
    list). The number of "prefixes" can therefore be greater than the
    number of leaves. The system also keeps statistics about the
    distribution of the internal nodes relative to the number of bits
    they handle. In our example, all the three internal nodes are
    handling 2 bits.

When a routing table is very dense, a node can handle many bits. For
example, a densily populated routing table with 1 million entries
packed in a /12 can have one internal node handling 20 bits. In this
case, route lookup is essentially reduced to a lookup in a vector.

The following graph shows the number of internal nodes used relative
to the number of routes for different scenarios (routes extracted from
an Internet full view, /32 routes spread over 4 different subnets
with various densities). When routes are densily packed, the number of
internal nodes are quite limited.

![Internal nodes and null pointers][i0]
[i0]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-nodes-v2.svg]] "Number of internal nodes and null pointers depending on the number of routes. The x-axis scale is logarithmic. The blue line is a linear regression."

## Performance

So how performant is a route lookup? The maximum depth stays low
(about 6 for a full view), so a lookup should be quite fast.  With the
help of a small [kernel module][], we can accurately benchmark[^bench]
the `fib_lookup()` function:

![Maximum depth and lookup time][i2]
[i2]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-maxdepth-v2.svg]] "Maximum depth and lookup time depending on the number of routes inserted. The x-axis scale is logarithmic."

[^bench]: The measurements are done in a virtual machine with one
    vCPU. The host is an [Intel Core i5-4670K][] running at 3.7 GHz
    during the experiment (CPU governor was set to performance). The
    benchmark is single-threaded. It runs a warm-up phase, then
    executes about 100,000 timed iterations and keeps the
    median. Timings of individual runs are computed from the TSC.

The lookup time is loosely tied to the maximum depth. When the routing
table is densily populated, the maximum depth is low and the lookup
times are fast.

When forwarding at 10 Gbps, the time budget for a packet would be
about 50 ns. Since this is also the time needed for the route lookup
alone in some cases, we wouldn't be able to forward at line rate with
only one core. Nonetheless, the results are pretty good and they are
expected to scale linearly with the number of cores.

The measurements are done with a Linux kernel 4.11 from *Debian
unstable*. I have gathered performance metrics across kernel versions
in “[Performance progression of IPv4 route lookup on Linux][].”

Another interesting figure is the time it takes to insert all these
routes into the kernel. Linux is also quite efficient in this area
since you can insert 2 million routes in less than 10 seconds:

![Insertion time][i3]
[i3]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-time-v2.svg]] "Insertion time (system time) for a given number of routes (linear). The x-axis scale is logarithmic. The blue line is a linear regression."

## Memory usage

The memory usage is available directly in
`/proc/net/fib_triestat`. The statistic provided doesn't account for
the `fib_info` structures, but you should only have a handful of them
(one for each possible next-hop). As you can see on the graph below,
the memory use is linear with the number of routes inserted, whatever
the shape of the routes is.

![Memory usage][i1]
[i1]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-memory-v2.svg]] "Memory usage of the LPC-trie depending on the number of routes inserted (linear). The x-axis cale is logarithmic. The blue line is a linear regression."

The results are quite good. With only 256 MiB, about 2 million routes
can be stored!

# Routing rules

Unless configured without `CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES`, **Linux
supports several routing tables** and has a system of configurable
rules to select the table to use. These rules can be configured with
`ip rule`. By default, there are three of them:

    ::console
    $ ip rule show
    0:      from all lookup local
    32766:  from all lookup main
    32767:  from all lookup default

Linux will first lookup for a match in the `local` table. If it
doesn't find one, it will lookup in the `main` table and at last
resort, the `default` table.

## Builtin tables

The `local` table contains routes for local delivery:

    ::console hl_lines="4 7"
    $ ip route show table local
    broadcast 127.0.0.0 dev lo proto kernel scope link src 127.0.0.1
    local 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127.0.0.1
    local 127.0.0.1 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127.0.0.1
    broadcast 127.255.255.255 dev lo proto kernel scope link src 127.0.0.1
    broadcast 192.168.117.0 dev eno1 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.117.55
    local 192.168.117.55 dev eno1 proto kernel scope host src 192.168.117.55
    broadcast 192.168.117.63 dev eno1 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.117.55

This table is populated automatically by the kernel when addresses are
configured. Let's look at the three last lines. When the IP address
`192.168.117.55` was configured on the `eno1` interface, the kernel
automatically added the appropriate routes:

 - a route for `192.168.117.55` for local unicast delivery to the IP address,
 - a route for `192.168.117.63` for broadcast delivery to the broadcast address,
 - a route for `192.168.117.0` for broadcast delivery to the network address.

When `127.0.0.1` was configured on the loopback interface, the same
kind of routes were added to the `local` table. However, a loopback
address receives a special treatment and the kernel also adds the
whole subnet to the `local` table. As a result, you can ping any IP in
`127.0.0.0/8`:

    ::console
    $ ping -c1 127.42.42.42
    PING 127.42.42.42 (127.42.42.42) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 127.42.42.42: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.039 ms
    
    --- 127.42.42.42 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.039/0.039/0.039/0.000 ms

The `main` table usually contains all the other routes:

    ::console
    $ ip route show table main
    default via 192.168.117.1 dev eno1 proto static metric 100
    192.168.117.0/26 dev eno1 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.117.55 metric 100

The `default` route has been configured by some DHCP daemon. The
connected route (`scope link`) has been automatically added by the
kernel (`proto kernel`) when configuring an IP address on the `eno1`
interface.

The `default` table is empty and has little use. It has been kept when
the current incarnation of advanced routing has been introduced in
Linux 2.1.68 after a first tentative using "classes" in Linux
2.1.15.[^old-doc]

[^old-doc]: Fun fact: the documentation of this first tentative of
    more flexible routing is still available in today's kernel tree
    and explains
    the [usage of the "default class"][policy-routing.txt].

## Performance

Since Linux 4.1 ([commit 0ddcf43d5d4a][]), when the set of rules is
left unmodified, the `main` and `local` tables are merged and the
lookup is done with this single table (and the `default` table if not
empty). Moreover, since Linux 3.0 ([commit f4530fa574df][]), without
specific rules, there is no performance hit when enabling the support
for multiple routing tables. However, as soon as you add new rules,
some CPU cycles will be spent for each datagram to evaluate them. Here
is a couple of graphs demonstrating the impact of routing rules on
lookup times:

![Routing rules impact on performance][i20]
[i20]: [[!!images/linux/lpc-trie-rules-v2.svg]] "Lookup time for a given number of routing rules. Only last routing rule matches. The first graph uses a logarithmic scale while the second uses a linear scale. The blue line is a linear regression."

For some reason, the relation is linear when the number of rules is
between 1 and 100 but the slope increases noticeably past this
threshold. The second graph highlights the negative impact of the
first rule (about 30 ns).

A common use of rules is to create **virtual routers**: interfaces
are segregated into domains and when a datagram enters through an
interface from domain *A*, it should use routing table *A*:

    ::console
    # ip rule add iif vlan457 table 10
    # ip rule add iif vlan457 blackhole
    # ip rule add iif vlan458 table 20
    # ip rule add iif vlan458 blackhole

The blackhole rules may be removed if you are sure there is a default
route in each routing table. For example, we add a blackhole default
with a high metric to not override a regular default route:

    ::console hl_lines="1 2"
    # ip route add blackhole default metric 9999 table 10
    # ip route add blackhole default metric 9999 table 20
    # ip rule add iif vlan457 table 10
    # ip rule add iif vlan458 table 20

To reduce the impact on performance when many interface-specific rules
are used, interfaces can be attached to VRF instances and a single
rule can be used to select the appropriate table:

    ::console hl_lines="5 6"
    # ip link add vrf-A type vrf table 10
    # ip link set dev vrf-A up
    # ip link add vrf-B type vrf table 20
    # ip link set dev vrf-B up
    # ip link set dev vlan457 master vrf-A
    # ip link set dev vlan458 master vrf-B
    # ip rule show
    0:      from all lookup local
    1000:   from all lookup [l3mdev-table]
    32766:  from all lookup main
    32767:  from all lookup default

The special `l3mdev-table` rule was automatically added when
configuring the first VRF interface. This rule will select the routing
table associated to the VRF owning the input (or output) interface.

VRF was introduced in Linux 4.3 ([commit 193125dbd8eb][]), the
performance was greatly enhanced in Linux 4.8
([commit 7889681f4a6c][]) and the special routing rule was also
introduced in Linux 4.8
([commit 96c63fa7393d][], [commit 1aa6c4f6b8cd][]). You can find more
details about it in the [kernel documentation][vrf.txt].

---

The takeaways from this article are:

 - route lookup times hardly increase with the number of routes,
 - densily packed /32 routes lead to amazingly fast route lookups,
 - memory use is low (128 MiB per million routes),
 - no optimization is done on routing rules.

For IPv6, have a look at “[IPv6 route lookup on Linux][].”
