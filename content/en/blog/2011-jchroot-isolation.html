Linux 2.6.24, released more than three years ago, introduced two very
interesting features: [PID and network namespaces][containers]. They
allow us to create a process that does not share the same PID namespace
or the same network namespace than other processes. These namespaces
are then inherited by the children (unless they are assigned new
namespaces).

# PID & mount namespaces

A PID namespace is a view of the processes running on the system. Each
PID namespace will have its own numbering of the processes contained
in its namespace (including the namespace of the children). Other
processes are hidden and therefore, it is not possible to issue any
operation requiring a PID on them, like [`kill(2)`][kill]. Moreover,
the process that was created first in a namespace will get PID 1. If
it gets killed, the namespace is destroyed and all other processes
contained in this namespace are killed as well. [systemd][systemd], a
system and service manager for Linux, targeted as a replacement for
the old SysV init, <del>uses</del> <ins>could use</ins> this feature to
launch daemons in their own PID namespace and keep track of them
without relying on their cooperation. When it needs to kill a daemon,
it just kills the process with PID 1 (which has another PID in the
global namespace) and the kernel will do the hard work of killing all
processes that were started in this namespace. You can get more
details about this namespace in the [manual page of `clone(2)`][clone]
(search for `CLONE_NEWPID`).

!!! "Update (2011-08)" In fact, *systemd* does not use PID namespaces
but *cgroups* to group processes together. There is no PID numbering
here but spawned processes are all enclosed into one *cgroup* and
therefore can be killed easily.

For example, here is the result of `pstree -p` inside a PID namespace:

    ::console
    # pstree -p
    bash(1)─┬─pstree(8)
            └─sleep(7)

The PID of `sleep` is 7. In the global namespace, it is 31762
instead. But it is the same process!

    ::console
    # ps -eo pid,command | grep sleep
    31762 sleep 1000

Linux have also supported mount namespaces since a long time. Each
process can have its own mount points that will be visible only by
processes in the same namespace or in children namespaces. When the
namespace is destroyed (when no process left), the kernel will
do the cleanup itself.

# chroot

A common way to test experimental software or do packaging work is to
build a chroot: `debootstrap` is used to build a new complete system
inside a directory and `chroot` allows one to "enter" into this new
system. Tools like `schroot` can become handy if you need to do that
often.

Unfortunately, you only get an isolated filesystem. When you start
launching daemons and mounting partitions, you need to keep track of
all your actions to undo them. Quitting the chroot will not kill any
daemon nor unmount any partition.

Extending an existing tool, like `schroot` to use PID and mount
namespaces seems the best way to prevent such problems. I have filed
[bug #637870][bug637870] for this purpose. However, this is not as
simple as it seems since `schroot` allows us to run a process into an
existing session. When the session is a chroot, this is quite easy:
just chroot into the same root filesystem and launch the process
here. With other kind of namespaces, you need to use a new system
call, `setns()`, to change the current namespace of the running
process. However, some bits are still missing. First, the GNU C
Library does not implement the appropriate wrapper. Second, Linux (as
of 3.0) does not contain the support to change the PID namespace of a
running process yet.

Other tools exist, like [lxc][lxc] (aka Linux Containers). However, it
is more targeted at providing a complete container. I have reported
that [`lxc-execute` is not able to spawn a standalone shell][bug637911] 
but got no luck.

!!! "Update (2011-08)" *systemd* ships with `systemd-nspawn` which was
exactly what I needed. However, it requires *systemd*. Otherwise, it
seems *less* basic than the alternative that I describe below (some
sensible mount points are setup, the console is correctly configured,
signals are correctly transmitted, ...). If you use *systemd*, look at
it!

# jchroot

Building a `chroot` clone using namespaces is quite easy. The only
difficulty is the use of [`clone(2)`][clone]. Here is a
sketch:

    ::c
    int main() {
      pid_t pid;
      int ret;
      long stack_size = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);
      void *stack = alloca(stack_size) + stack_size;
      /* New process with its own PID/IPC/NS namespace */
      pid = clone(step2,
                  stack,
                  SIGCHLD | CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWIPC |
                  CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_FILES,
                  NULL);
      /* Wait for the child to terminate */
      while (waitpid(pid, &ret, 0) < 0 && errno == EINTR)
        continue;
      return WIFEXITED(ret)?WEXITSTATUS(ret):EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    
    static int step2(void *a) {
      /* Mount /proc as an example */
      mount("proc", "/proc", "proc", 0, "");
      /* Chroot */
      chroot("/srv/debian");
      chdir("/");
      /* Drop privileges */
      setgid(1000);
      setgroups(0, NULL);
      setuid(1000);
      /* Exec shell */
      execl("/bin/bash", "/bin/bash", NULL);
    }

Add command flags, error handling and fstab parsing for the definition
of mount points and you get [jchroot][jchroot]. Here is an example of
usage:

    ::console
    $ cat fstab
    proc     /proc  proc    defaults                  0  0
    sys      /sys   sysfs   defaults                  0  0
    /home    /home  none    bind,rw                   0  0
    /dev/pts /dev/pts none  bind,rw                   0  0
    /var/run /var/run tmpfs rw,nosuid,noexec,mode=755 0  0
    /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf none bind,ro    0  0
    $ sudo jchroot -f fstab -n test /srv/debian/squeeze /bin/bash
    # hostname
    test
    # ps auxww
    USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    root         1  0.0  0.0  19480  1888 pts/1    S    15:18   0:00 /bin/bash
    root         3  0.0  0.0  16536  1184 pts/1    R+   15:18   0:00 ps auxww
    # /etc/init.d/postgresql start
    Starting PostgreSQL 9.0 database server: main.
    # exit
    $ ps auxwwc | grep postgres
    $

I hope that *jchroot* won't live for too long and that its features
will be integrated into regular chroot tools. I was thinking at
proposing a patch for `chroot(8)`. Anyone knows if this would have a
chance to be accepted?
