One of the best way to
[add SNMP support to an application is the use of AgentX protocol][extending-netsnmp]:
an application can act as a *subagent* and handle requests from a
*master agent* using AgentX protocol. The most widespread
implementation for such a task is the one from Net-SNMP.

**TL;DR**: An application asynchronously leveraging Net-SNMP AgentX
implementation has many opportunities to get stuck when the master
agent becomes temporarily unavailable. A mostly efficient workaround
is to dedicate a master agent for AgentX and delegate MIB handling to
a subagent.

# Pinging the master agent

Net-SNMP uses an event-based model. It also provides some synchronous
functions but they are built on top of the asynchronous ones. It is
shipped with its own event loop. Therefore, Net-SNMP AgentX protocol
implementation seems a fine choice to add SNMP support to an
event-based program, for example in [Keepalived][keepalived], a VRRP
daemon and a monitoring daemon for LVS clusters.

Unfortunately, an AgentX subagent is expected to check, at a regular
interval, if the master agent is alive . This is handled automatically
with Net-SNMP implementation as long as you call `run_alarms()`
function which will call `agentx_check_session()`:

    ::c
    /*
     * check a session validity for connectivity to the master agent.  If
     * not functioning, close and start attempts to reopen the session 
     */
    void
    agentx_check_session(unsigned int clientreg, void *clientarg)
    {
        /* [...] */
        DEBUGMSGTL(("agentx/subagent", "checking status of session %p\n", ss));

        if (!agentx_send_ping(ss)) {
            snmp_log(LOG_WARNING,
                     "AgentX master agent failed to respond to ping.  Attempting to re-register.\n");
            /*
             * master agent disappeared?  Try and re-register.
             * close first, just to be sure .
             */
            agentx_unregister_callbacks(ss);
            agentx_close_session(ss, AGENTX_CLOSE_TIMEOUT);
            /* [...] */
            if (main_session != NULL) {
                /* [...] */
                main_session = NULL;
                agentx_reopen_session(0, NULL);
            }
            else {
                snmp_close(main_session);
                main_session = NULL;
            }
        } else {
            DEBUGMSGTL(("agentx/subagent", "session %p responded to ping\n",
                        ss));
        }
    }

This piece of code will end up calling (directly or indirectly) the
following functions[^synchfunctions] which are using
`agentx_synch_response()`:

 - `agentx_send_ping()`
 - `agentx_open_session()`
 - `agentx_reopen_session()`
 - `agentx_close_session()`
 - `agentx_register()`
 - `agentx_unregister()`
 - `agentx_register_index()`
 - `agentx_unregister_index()`
 - `agentx_add_agentcaps()`
 - `agentx_remove_agentcaps()`
 
[^synchfunctions]: `agentx_reopen_session()` will call `agentx_close_session()`
                   and `agentx_open_session()`. `agentx_register()` and
                   the following functions will be called by those
                   two functions.

`agentx_synch_response()` will **synchronously** wait for an answer
from the master agent. Your event-based program will just sit here
doing nothing while this happens. For example, *keepalived* may be
unable to send VRRP probes resulting in some serious havoc in your
cluster.

Functions prefixed by `agentx_` are not part of NetSNMP API and could
therefore be rewritten to do their work asynchronously. Unfortunately,
[talk is][runalarms1] [cheap][runalarms2]. Moreover, there exists
other deep paths that will block a subagent. For example, the
low-level connection to the master agent (using TCP or a Unix socket,
but not with UDP) will use a blocking `connect()` call. It seems quite
difficult to fix this.

Here are some (partial) workarounds:

 - Call `agentx_check_session()` less often. The default interval is
   15 seconds. Disabling it completely or using a very high value is
   not advised because this function is the only way to reestablish a
   connection to the master agent when it is, for example,
   restarted. Here is how to change the delay to 120 seconds:

        ::c
        netsnmp_ds_set_int(NETSNMP_DS_APPLICATION_ID,
                           NETSNMP_DS_AGENT_AGENTX_PING_INTERVAL, 120);

 - Don't call `agentx_check_session()` if we know the master agent is
   alive. For example, if it just sent us a new request, no need to
   ping it. I have written a
   [patch implementing such a workaround][noping]. The ABI is left
   untouched, therefore, you only need to recompile Net-SNMP
   libraries.

 - Use a lower timeout and no retry. By default, the timeout for
   synchronous requests is 1 second and a failed request will be
   retried 5 times. Because several synchronous functions are used in
   a row, you may be trapped for as long as 30 seconds with those
   settings. Here is how[^how] to disable the retry mechanism and to
   set the timeout to a very low value:

        ::c
        static int
        snmp_setup_session_cb(int majorID, int minorID,
                      void *serverarg, void *clientarg)
        {
            netsnmp_session *sess = serverarg;
            sess->timeout = ONE_SEC / 3;
            sess->retries = 0;
            return 0;
        }

        void some_init_function()
        {
            /* [...] */
            snmp_register_callback(SNMP_CALLBACK_LIBRARY,
               SNMP_CALLBACK_SESSION_INIT,
               snmp_setup_session_cb, NULL);
            /* [...] */
        }

[^how]: `NETSNMP_DS_AGENT_AGENTX_TIMEOUT` and `NETSNMP_DS_AGENT_AGENTX_RETRIES`
        variables are only used by the master agent, not by a subagent.

# Unresponsive master agent

Why is the master agent unresponsive? `snmpd` is also an event-based
program and, trust me, there are a lot of places where it will become
unresponsive. Here are two examples:

 - When using the `pass` or the `pass_persist` directive, Net-SNMP
   will block until the delegated command outputs a complete line.

        ::c
        /* var_extensible_pass() in agent/mibgroup/ucd-snmp/pass.c */
        /*
         * valid call.  Exec and get output 
         */
        if ((fd = get_exec_output(passthru)) != -1) {
            file = fdopen(fd, "r");
            if (fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), file) == NULL) {
                fclose(file);
                wait_on_exec(passthru);
                /* [...] */
                continue;
            }
            /* [...] */
            fclose(file);
            wait_on_exec(passthru);
            /* [...] */
        }

 - `DISMAN-PING-MIB` implementation will just hang while pinging the
   remote host. If the host is down and you have requested 5 probes
   with a timeout of 1 second, `snmpd` will be unresponsive for 5
   seconds. A similar problem exists with `DISMAN-TRACEROUTE-MIB`.

# Minimal master agent

More and more code is running in the main agent. You cannot expect it
to not block. But we could add a *minimal master agent* to the mix: it
will handle only a few MIB modules by itself while most MIB modules
will be delagated to a complete agent running as a subagent. Your own
subagent will connect to the minimal master agent.

![Schema showing the use of a minimal master agent][minimal-snmpd]
[minimal-snmpd]: [[!!images/minimal-snmpd.png]] "Adding a minimal master agent and turning snmpd into a subagent"

It is quite easy to turn `snmpd` into a subagent: just use `-X`
flag. We should also disable unwanted MIB modules for each agent with
`-I` flag. For the minimal master agent, we only enable some
modules. All other modules[^modules] will be served by `snmpd` acting
as a subagent.

    ::console
    $ MODS="snmp_mib,sysORTable,usmConf,usmStats,usmUser,vacm_conf,vacm_context,vacm_vars"
    $ snmpd -Lsd -Lf /dev/null -u snmp -g snmp \
    >   -C -c /etc/snmp/snmpd.master.conf \
    >   -p /var/run/snmpd.master.pid \
    >   -I $MODS
    $ snmpd -Lsd -Lf /dev/null -u snmp -g snmp \
    >   -p /var/run/snmpd.pid -X \
    >   -I -$MODS

[^modules]: Use `snmpd -Dmib_init -H` to get the list of modules. You
            may want to add `smux` module to the master agent.

Access control configuration should be placed in
`/etc/snmp/snmpd.master.conf`, as well as `master agentx`
directive. Other directives (like `pass`, `pass_persist`, `load`,
`sysname`, ...) in `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`.

The minimal master agent is very unlikely to block and while the
ground cause is still here, it is now very much mitigated. You may
extend this solution by splicing `snmpd` into several subagents: one
handling safe modules, one handling `pass` and `pass_persist` stuff
and a last one for unsafe modules (like `DISMAN-PING-MIB`).
