Recently, I have been gathering some old hardware at my parents'
house, notably PC extension cards, as they don't take much room and
can be converted to a nice display item. Unfortunately, I was not very
concerned about keeping stuff around. Compared to all the hardware I
have acquired over the years, only a few pieces remain.

# Tseng Labs ET4000AX (1989)

This SVGA graphics card was installed into a PC powered by a 386SX CPU
running at 16 MHz. This was a good card at the time as it was pretty
fast. It didn't feature 2D acceleration, unlike the later ET4000/W32.
This version only features 512 KB of RAM. It can display 1024×768
images with 16 colors or 800×600 with 256 colors. It was also
compatible with CGA, EGA, VGA, MDA, and Hercules modes. No
contemporary games were using the SVGA modes but the higher
resolutions were useful with Windows 3. This card was manufactured
directly by Tseng Labs.

# AdLib clone (1992)

My first sound card was an AdLib. My parents bought it in Canada
during the summer holidays in 1992. It uses a Yamaha OPL2 chip to
produce sound via FM synthesis. The first game I have tried is
[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade][].

I think I gave this AdLib to a friend once I upgraded my PC with a
Sound Blaster Pro 2. Recently, I needed one for a side project, but
they are rare and expensive on eBay. Someone mentioned a cheap clone
on [Vogons][], so I bought it. It was sold by Sun Moon Star in 1992
and shipped with a CD-ROM of Doom shareware.

On this topic, take a look at "[OPL2LPT: an AdLib sound card for the
parallel port][]" and "[OPL2 Audio Board: an AdLib sound card for
Arduino][]". The first article includes a more exact copy of an AdLib
clone.

# Sound Blaster Pro 2 (1992)

Later, I switched the AdLib sound card with a Sound Blaster Pro 2. It
features an OPL3 chip and was also able to output digital samples. At
the time, this was a welcome addition, but not as important as the FM
synthesis introduced earlier by the AdLib.

# Promise EIDE 2300 Plus (1995)

I bought this card mostly for the serial port. I was using a 486DX2
running at 66 MHz with a Creatix LC 288 FC external modem. The serial
port was driven by an 8250 UART with no buffer. Thanks to
[Terminate][], I was able to connect to [BBSes][] with DOS, but this
was not possible with Windows 3 or OS/2. I needed one of these fancy
new cards with a 16550 UART, featuring a 16-byte buffer. At the time,
this was quite difficult to find in France. During a holiday trip, I
convinced my parent to make a short detour from Los Angeles to San
Diego to buy this *Promise EIDE 2300 Plus* controller card at a shop I
located through an advertisement in a local magazine!

The card also features an EIDE controller with multi-word DMA mode 2
support. In contrast with the older PIO modes, the CPU didn't have to
copy data from disk to memory.

# 3dfx Voodoo2 Magic 3D II (1998)

The 3dfx Voodoo2 was one of the first add-in graphics cards
implementing hardware acceleration of 3D graphics. I bought it from a
friend along with his Pentium II box in 1999. It was a big
evolutionary step in PC gaming, as games became more beautiful and
fluid. A traditional video controller was still required for 2D. A
pass-through VGA cable daisy-chained the video controller to the
Voodoo, which was itself connected to the monitor.

# 3Com 3C905C-TX-M "Tornado" (1999)

In the early 2000s, in college, the Internet connection on the campus
was provided by a [student association][] through a  100 Mbps Ethernet
cable. If you wanted to reach the maximum speed, the *3Com
3C905C-TX-M* PCI network adapter, nicknamed "Tornado", was the card
you needed. We would buy it second-hand by the dozen and sell them to
other students for around 30 €.
