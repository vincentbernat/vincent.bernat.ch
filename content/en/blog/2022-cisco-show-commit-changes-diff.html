title: "Broken commit diff on Cisco IOSÂ XR"
description: |
   The diff between the running and the candidate configurations produced by
   Cisco IOSÂ XR are often incorrect. This post provides a few examples.

!!! "TL;DR" Never trust `show commit changes diff` on Cisco IOSÂ XR.

[Cisco IOSÂ XR][XR] is the operating system running for the Cisco ASR, NCS, and
8000 routers. Compared to [Cisco IOS][IOS], it features a **candidate
configuration** and a **running configuration**. In configuration mode, you can
modify the first one and issue the `commit` command to apply it to the running
configuration.[^limitations] This is a common concept for many NOS.

[^limitations]: IOSÂ XR has several limitations. The most inconvenient one is the
    inability to change the AS number in the `router bgp` directive. Such a
    limitation is a great pain for both operations and automation.

Before committing the candidate configuration to the running configuration, you
may want to check the changes that have accumulated until now. That's where the
`show commit changes diff` command[^clunky] comes up. Its goal is to show the
difference between the running configuration (`show running-configuration`) and
the candidate configuration (`show configuration merge`). How hard can it be?

[^clunky]: This command could have been just `show commit`, as `show commit
    changes diff` is the only valid command you can execute from this point.
    Starting from IOSÂ XR 7.5.1, `show commit changes diff precise` is also a
    valid command. However, I have failed to find any documentation about it and
    it seems to provide the same output as `show commit changes diff`. That's
    how clunky IOSÂ XR can be.

Let's put an interface down on IOSÂ XR 7.6.2 (released in August 2022):

    ::console
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#int Hu0/1/0/1 shut
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#show commit changes diff
    Wed Nov 23 11:08:30.275 CET
    Building configuration...
    !! IOS XR Configuration 7.6.2
    +  interface HundredGigE0/1/0/1
    +   shutdown
       !
    end

The `+` sign before `interface HundredGigE0/1/0/1` makes it look like you did
create a new interface. Maybe there was a typo? No, the diff is just broken. If
you look at the candidate configuration, everything is like you expect:

    ::console
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#show configuration merge int Hu0/1/0/1
    Wed Nov 23 11:08:43.360 CET
    interface HundredGigE0/1/0/1
     description PNI: (some description)
     bundle id 4000 mode active
     lldp
      receive disable
      transmit disable
     !
     shutdown
     load-interval 30

Here is a more problematic example on IOSÂ XR 7.2.2 (released in January 2021).
We want to unconfigure three interfaces:

    ::console
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#no int GigabitEthernet 0/0/0/5
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#int TenGigE 0/0/0/5 shut
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#no int TenGigE 0/0/0/28
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#int TenGigE 0/0/0/28 shut
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#no int TenGigE 0/0/0/29
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#int TenGigE 0/0/0/29 shut
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#show commit changes diff
    Mon Nov  7 15:07:22.990 CET
    Building configuration...
    !! IOS XR Configuration 7.2.2
    -  interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/5
    -   shutdown
       !
    +  interface TenGigE0/0/0/5
    +   shutdown
       !
       interface TenGigE0/0/0/28
    -   description Trunk (some description)
    -   bundle id 2 mode active
       !
    end

The two first commands are correctly represented by the first two chunks of the
diff: we remove `GigabitEthernet0/0/0/5` and create `TenGigE0/0/0/5`. The two
next commands are also correctly represented by the last chunk of the diff.
`TenGigE0/0/0/28` was already shut down, so it is expected that only
`description` and `bundle id` are removed. However, the `diff` command forgets
about the modifications for `TenGigE0/0/0/29`. The diff should include a chunk
similar to the last one.

    ::console
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#show run int TenGigE 0/0/0/29
    Mon Nov  7 15:07:43.571 CET
    interface TenGigE0/0/0/29
     description Trunk to other router
     bundle id 2 mode active
     shutdown
    !
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#show configuration merge int TenGigE 0/0/0/29
    Mon Nov  7 15:07:53.584 CET
    interface TenGigE0/0/0/29
     shutdown
    !

How can the diff be correct for `TenGigE0/0/0/28` but incorrect for
`TenGigE0/0/0/29` while they have the same configuration? How can you trust the
`diff` command if it forgets part of the configuration?

Do you remember the last time you ran an Ansible playbook and discovered the
whole `router ospf` block disappeared without a warning? If you use automation
tools, you should check how the diff is assembled. Automation tools should build
it from the result of `show running-config` and `show configuration merge`. This
is what [NAPALM][] does. This is not what [`cisco.iosxr`
collection][cisco.iosxr] for Ansible does.

The problem is not limited to the `interface` directives. You can get similar
issues for other parts of the configuration. For example, here is what we get
when removing inactive BGP neighbors on IOSÂ XR 7.2.2:

    ::console
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)#router bgp 65400
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-bgp)#vrf public
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-bgp-vrf)#no neighbor 217.29.66.1
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-bgp-vrf)#no neighbor 217.29.66.75
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-bgp-vrf)#no neighbor 217.29.66.110
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-bgp-vrf)#no neighbor 217.29.66.112
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-bgp-vrf)#no neighbor 217.29.66.158
    RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-bgp-vrf)#show commit changes diff
    Tue Aug  2 13:58:02.536 CEST
    Building configuration...
    !! IOS XR Configuration 7.2.2
       router bgp 65400
        vrf public
    -    neighbor 217.29.66.1
    -     remote-as 16004
    -     use neighbor-group MIX_IPV4_PUBLIC
    -     description MIX: MIX-IT
         !
    -    neighbor 217.29.66.75
    -     remote-as 49367
    -     use neighbor-group MIX_IPV4_PUBLIC
         !
    -    neighbor 217.29.67.10
    -     remote-as 19679
         !
    -    neighbor 217.29.67.15
    -    neighbor 217.29.66.112
    -     remote-as 8075
    -     use neighbor-group MIX_IPV4_PUBLIC
    -     description MIX: Microsoft
    -     address-family ipv4 unicast
    -      maximum-prefix 1500 95 restart 5
          !
         !
    -    neighbor 217.29.66.158
    -     remote-as 24482
    -     use neighbor-group MIX_IPV4_PUBLIC
    -     description MIX: SG.GS
    -     address-family ipv4 unicast
         !
         !
        !
       !
    end

The only correct chunk is for neighbor 217.29.66.112. All the others are missing
some of the removed lines. 217.29.67.15 is even missing all of them. How bad is
the code providing such a diff?

I could go all day with examples such as these. Cisco TAC is happy to open a
case in DDTS, their bug tracker, to fix specific occurrences of this
bug.[^example] However, I fail to understand why the XR team is not just
providing the diff between `show run` and `show configuration merge`. The output
would always be correct! ðŸ™„

[^example]: See [CSCwa26251][] as an example of a fix for something I reported
    earlier this year. You need a valid Cisco support contract to be able to see
    its content.
