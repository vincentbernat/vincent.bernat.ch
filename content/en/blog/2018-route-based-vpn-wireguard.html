In a [previous article][], I described an implementation of redundant
site-to-site VPNs using IPsec (with [strongSwan][] as an IKE daemon) and BGP
(with [BIRD][]) to achieve this: ðŸ¦‘

![Redundant VPNs between 3 sites]([[!!images/vpn-routed.svg]] "Three sites using redundant IPsec VPNs to protect some subnets.")

The two strengths of such a setup are:

1. **Routing daemons** distribute routes to be protected by the VPNs. They
   provide high availability and decrease the administrative burden when many
   subnets are present on each side.
2. Encapsulation and decapsulation are executed in a **different network
   namespace**. This enables a clean separation between a private routing
   instance (where VPN users are) and a public routing instance (where VPN
   endpoints are).

As an alternative to IPsec, [WireGuard][] is an extremely simple (less than
5,000 lines of code) yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art and
opinionated cryptography ([Curve25519][], [ChaCha20][], [Poly1305][]) and whose
protocol, based on [Noise][], has been [formally verified][]. <del>It is
currently available as an out-of-tree module for Linux but is currently being
integrated into mainline.</del> Compared to IPsec, its major weakness is its
lack of interoperability.

!!! "Update (2020-07)" WireGuard is part of Linux since the 5.6 release.

It can easily replace *strongSwan* in our site-to-site setup. On Linux, it
already acts as a route-based VPN. As a first step, for each VPN, we create a
private key and extract the associated public key:

    ::console
    $ wg genkey
    oM3PZ1Htc7FnACoIZGhCyrfeR+Y8Yh34WzDaulNEjGs=
    $ echo oM3PZ1Htc7FnACoIZGhCyrfeR+Y8Yh34WzDaulNEjGs= | wg pubkey
    hV1StKWfcC6Yx21xhFvoiXnWONjGHN1dFeibN737Wnc=

Then, for each remote VPN, we create a short configuration file:[^simplicity]

    ::ini
    [Interface]
    PrivateKey = oM3PZ1Htc7FnACoIZGhCyrfeR+Y8Yh34WzDaulNEjGs=
    ListenPort = 5803
    
    [Peer]
    PublicKey  = Jixsag44W8CFkKCIvlLSZF86/Q/4BovkpqdB9Vps5Sk=
    EndPoint   = [2001:db8:2::1]:5801
    AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0,::/0

[^simplicity]: Compared to IPsec, the cryptography is not configurable and you
    have to use the strong provided defaults.

A new `ListenPort` value should be used for each remote VPN. *WireGuard* can
multiplex several peers over the same UDP port but this is not applicable here,
as the routing is dynamic. The `AllowedIPs` directive tells to accept and send
any traffic.

The next step is to create and configure the tunnel interface for each remote
VPN:

    ::console
    $ ip link add dev wg3 type wireguard
    $ wg setconf wg3 wg3.conf

*WireGuard* initiates a handshake to establish symmetric keys:

    ::console hl_lines="10"
    $ wg show wg3
    interface: wg3
      public key: hV1StKWfcC6Yx21xhFvoiXnWONjGHN1dFeibN737Wnc=
      private key: (hidden)
      listening port: 5803
    
    peer: Jixsag44W8CFkKCIvlLSZF86/Q/4BovkpqdB9Vps5Sk=
      endpoint: [2001:db8:2::1]:5801
      allowed ips: 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
      latest handshake: 55 seconds ago
      transfer: 49.84 KiB received, 49.89 KiB sent

Like VTI interfaces, *WireGuard* tunnel interfaces are [namespace-aware][]: once
created, they can be moved into another network namespace where clear traffic is
encapsulated and decapsulated. Encrypted traffic is routed in its original
namespace. Let's move each interface into the `private` namespace and assign it
a point-to-point IP address:

    ::console
    $ ip link set netns private dev wg3
    $ ip -n private addr add 2001:db8:ff::/127 dev wg3
    $ ip -n private link set wg3 up

The remote end uses `2001:db8:ff::1/127`. Once everything is setup, from one
VPN, we should be able to ping each remote host:

    ::console
    $ ip netns exec private fping 2001:db8:ff::{1,3,5,7}
    2001:db8:ff::1 is alive
    2001:db8:ff::3 is alive
    2001:db8:ff::5 is alive
    2001:db8:ff::7 is alive

*BIRD* configuration is unmodified compared to our [previous setup][previous
article] and the BGP sessions should establish quickly:

    ::console
    $ birdc6 -s /run/bird6.private.ctl show proto | grep IBGP_
    IBGP_V2_1 BGP      master   up     20:16:31    Established
    IBGP_V2_2 BGP      master   up     20:16:31    Established
    IBGP_V3_1 BGP      master   up     20:16:31    Established
    IBGP_V3_2 BGP      master   up     20:16:29    Established

Remote routes are learnt over the different tunnel interfaces:

    ::console
    $ ip -6 -n private route show proto bird
    2001:db8:a1::/64 via fe80::5254:33ff:fe00:13 dev eth2 metric 1024 pref medium
    2001:db8:a2::/64 metric 1024
            nexthop via 2001:db8:ff::1 dev wg3 weight 1
            nexthop via 2001:db8:ff::3 dev wg4 weight 1
    2001:db8:a3::/64 metric 1024
            nexthop via 2001:db8:ff::5 dev wg5 weight 1
            nexthop via 2001:db8:ff::7 dev wg6 weight 1

From one site, you can ping a host on the other site through the VPNs:

    ::console
    $ ping -c 2 2001:db8:a3::1
    PING 2001:db8:a3::1(2001:db8:a3::1) 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 2001:db8:a3::1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=62 time=1.54 ms
    64 bytes from 2001:db8:a3::1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=62 time=1.67 ms
    
    --- 2001:db8:a3::1 ping statistics ---
    2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 1001ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.542/1.607/1.672/0.065 ms

As with the *strongSwan* setup, you can easily snoop unencrypted traffic with
`tcpdump`:

    ::console
    $ ip netns exec private tcpdump -c3 -pni wg5 icmp6
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
    listening on wg5, link-type RAW (Raw IP), capture size 262144 bytes
    08:34:34 IP6 2001:db8:a3::1 > 2001:db8:a1::1: ICMP6, echo reply, seq 40
    08:34:35 IP6 2001:db8:a3::1 > 2001:db8:a1::1: ICMP6, echo reply, seq 41
    08:34:36 IP6 2001:db8:a3::1 > 2001:db8:a1::1: ICMP6, echo reply, seq 42
    3 packets captured
    3 packets received by filter
    0 packets dropped by kernel

You can find all the configuration files for this example on [GitHub][].

!!! "Update (2018-11)" It is also possible to transport IPv4 on top of IPv6
*WireGuard* tunnels. The lab has been [updated][v4overv6] to support such a
scenario.
