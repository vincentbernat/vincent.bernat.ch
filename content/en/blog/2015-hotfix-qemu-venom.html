[CVE-2015-3456][], also known as [VENOM][], is a security
vulnerability in [QEMU][] virtual floppy controller:

> The Floppy Disk Controller (FDC) in *QEMU*, as used in *Xen* [...]
> and *KVM*, allows local guest users to cause a denial of service
> (out-of-bounds write and guest crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
> code via the `FD_CMD_READ_ID`, `FD_CMD_DRIVE_SPECIFICATION_COMMAND`,
> or other unspecified commands.

Even when *QEMU* has been configured with no floppy drive, the
floppy controller code is still active. The vulnerability is easy to
test:[^exploit]

    ::c
    #define FDC_IOPORT 0x3f5
    #define FD_CMD_READ_ID 0x0a
    
    int main() {
        ioperm(FDC_IOPORT, 1, 1);
        outb(FD_CMD_READ_ID, FDC_IOPORT);
        for (size_t i = 0;; i++)
            outb(0x42, FDC_IOPORT);
        return 0;
    }

[^exploit]: The complete code for this test is on [GitHub][exploit].

Once the fix installed, all processes still have to be restarted for
the upgrade to be effective. It is possible to minimize the downtime
by [leveraging `virsh save`][virsh-save].

Another possibility would be to patch the running processes. The Linux
kernel attracted a lot of interest in this area, with solutions like
[Ksplice][] (mostly killed by Oracle), [kGraft][] (by SUSE) and
[kpatch][] (by Red Hat) and the inclusion of a [common framework][] in
the kernel. The userspace has far less out-of-the-box solutions.[^userspace]

[^userspace]: An interesting project seems to be [Katana][]. But there
              are also some insightful [hacking][1] [papers][2] on
              the subject.

I present here a simple and self-contained way to patch a running
*QEMU* to remove the vulnerability without requiring any sensible
downtime. Here is a short demonstration:

![]([[!!videos/2015-hotfix-qemu-venom.m3u8]])

# Proof of concept

First, let's find a workaround that would be simple to implement
through live patching: while modifying running code text is possible,
it is easier to modify a single variable.

## Concept

Looking at the [code of the floppy controller][code] and the
[patch][], we can avoid the vulnerability by not accepting any command
on the FIFO port. Each request would be answered by "*Invalid
command*" (`0x80`) and a user won't be able to push more bytes to the
FIFO until the answer is read and the FIFO queue reset. The
floppy controller would be rendered useless in this state, but who
cares?

The list of commands accepted by the controller on the FIFO port is
contained in the `handlers[]` array:

    ::c
    static const struct {
        uint8_t value;
        uint8_t mask;
        const char* name;
        int parameters;
        void (*handler)(FDCtrl *fdctrl, int direction);
        int direction;
    } handlers[] = {
        { FD_CMD_READ, 0x1f, "READ", 8, fdctrl_start_transfer, FD_DIR_READ },
        { FD_CMD_WRITE, 0x3f, "WRITE", 8, fdctrl_start_transfer, FD_DIR_WRITE },
        /* [...] */
        { 0, 0, "unknown", 0, fdctrl_unimplemented }, /* default handler */
    };

To avoid browsing the array each time a command is received, another
array is used to map each command to the appropriate handler:

    ::c
    /* Associate command to an index in the 'handlers' array */
    static uint8_t command_to_handler[256];
    
    static void fdctrl_realize_common(FDCtrl *fdctrl, Error **errp)
    {
        int i, j;
        static int command_tables_inited = 0;
    
        /* Fill 'command_to_handler' lookup table */
        if (!command_tables_inited) {
            command_tables_inited = 1;
            for (i = ARRAY_SIZE(handlers) - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                for (j = 0; j < sizeof(command_to_handler); j++) {
                    if ((j & handlers[i].mask) == handlers[i].value) {
                        command_to_handler[j] = i;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        /* [...] */
    }

Our workaround is to modify the `command_to_handler[]` array to map
all commands to the `fdctrl_unimplemented()` handler (the last one in
the `handlers[]` array).

## Testing with gdb

To check if the workaround works as expected, we test it with `gdb`.
Unless you have compiled *QEMU* yourself, you need to install a
package with debug symbols. <del>Unfortunately, on Debian, they are
not available, yet.</del> On Ubuntu, you can install the
`qemu-system-x86-dbgsym` package after [enabling the appropriate
repositories][].

!!! "Update (2018.11)" Automatic debug packages are [available since
Debian *Stretch*][automatically produce debugging symbols]. Like for
Ubuntu, a dedicated repository needs to be enabled.

The following function for `gdb` maps every command to the
unimplemented handler:

    ::text
    define patch
      set $handler = sizeof(handlers)/sizeof(*handlers)-1
      set $i = 0
      while ($i < 256)
       set variable command_to_handler[$i++] = $handler
      end
      printf "Done!\n"
    end

Attach to the vulnerable process (with `attach`), call the function
(with `patch`) and detach of the process (with `detach`). You can
check that the exploit is not working anymore. This could be
[easily automated][].

## Limitations

Using *gdb* has two main limitations:

 1. It needs to be installed on each host to be patched.
 2. The debug packages need to be installed as well. Moreover, it can
    be difficult to fetch previous versions of these packages.

# Writing a custom patcher

To overcome these limitations, we can write a customer patcher
using the [`ptrace()` system call][ptrace] without relying on debug
symbols being present.

## Finding the right memory spot

Before being able to modify the `command_to_handler[]` array, we need
to know its location. The first clue is given by the symbol table. To
query it, use `readelf -s`:

    ::console
    $ readelf -s /usr/lib/debug/.build-id/09/95121eb46e2a4c13747ac2bad982829365c694.debug | \
        sed -n -e 1,3p -e /command_to_handler/p
    
    Symbol table '.symtab' contains 27066 entries:
       Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
      8485: 00000000009f9d00   256 OBJECT  LOCAL  DEFAULT   26 command_to_handler

This table is usually stripped out of the executable to save space,
like shown below:

    ::console
    $ file -b /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 | tr , \\n
    ELF 64-bit LSB shared object
     x86-64
     version 1 (SYSV)
     dynamically linked
     interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
     for GNU/Linux 2.6.32
     BuildID[sha1]=0995121eb46e2a4c13747ac2bad982829365c694
     stripped

If your distribution provides a debug package, the debug symbols are
installed in `/usr/lib/debug`. Most modern distributions are now
relying on the build ID[^buildid] to map an executable to its
debugging symbols, like the example above. Without a debug package,
you need to recompile the existing package without stripping debug
symbols in a clean environment.[^reproducible] On Debian, this can be
done by setting the `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS` environment variable to
`nostrip`.

[^buildid]: The Fedora Wiki contains the [rationale behind the build ID][].

[^reproducible]: If the build is incorrectly reproduced, the build ID
                 won't match. The information provided by the debug
                 symbols may or may not be correct. Debian currently
                 has a [reproducible builds][] effort to ensure that
                 each package can be reproduced.

We have now two possible cases:

 - the easy one, and
 - the hard one.

### The easy case

On x86, here is the standard layout of a *regular* Linux process in
memory:[^more]

![Memory layout of a regular process on x86][x86-layout-regular]
[x86-layout-regular]: [[!!images/memory-layout-regular-v2.svg]] "Memory layout of a regular process on Linux x86 with ASLR."

[^more]: [Anatomy of a program in memory][] is a great blog post
         explaining in more details how a program lives in memory.

The random gaps (ASLR) are here to prevent an attacker from reliably
jumping to a particular exploited function in memory. On x86-64, the
layout is quite similar. The important point is that **the base
address of the executable is fixed**.

The memory mapping of a process is also available through
`/proc/PID/maps`. Here is a shortened and annotated example on x86-64:

    ::console
    $ cat /proc/3609/maps
    00400000-00401000         r-xp 00000000 fd:04 483  not-qemu [text segment]
    00601000-00602000         r--p 00001000 fd:04 483  not-qemu [data segment]
    00602000-00603000         rw-p 00002000 fd:04 483  not-qemu [BSS segment]
    [random gap]
    02419000-0293d000         rw-p 00000000 00:00 0    [heap]
    [random gap]
    7f0835543000-7f08356e2000 r-xp 00000000 fd:01 9319 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so
    7f08356e2000-7f08358e2000 ---p 0019f000 fd:01 9319 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so
    7f08358e2000-7f08358e6000 r--p 0019f000 fd:01 9319 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so
    7f08358e6000-7f08358e8000 rw-p 001a3000 fd:01 9319 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so
    7f08358e8000-7f08358ec000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
    7f08358ec000-7f083590c000 r-xp 00000000 fd:01 5138 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.19.so
    7f0835aca000-7f0835acd000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
    7f0835b08000-7f0835b0c000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
    7f0835b0c000-7f0835b0d000 r--p 00020000 fd:01 5138 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.19.so
    7f0835b0d000-7f0835b0e000 rw-p 00021000 fd:01 5138 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.19.so
    7f0835b0e000-7f0835b0f000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
    [random gap]
    7ffdb0f85000-7ffdb0fa6000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0    [stack]

With a regular executable, the value given in the symbol table is
an absolute memory address:

    ::console
    $ readelf -s not-qemu | \
        sed -n -e 1,3p -e /command_to_handler/p
    
    Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 9 entries:
       Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
        47: 0000000000602080   256 OBJECT  LOCAL  DEFAULT   25 command_to_handler

So, the address of `command_to_handler[]`, in the above example, is
`0x602080`.

### The hard case

To enhance security, it is possible to load some executables at a
random base address, just like a library. Such an executable is called
a *Position Independent Executable* (PIE). An attacker won't be able
to rely on a fixed address to find some helpful function. Here is the
new memory layout:

![Memory layout of a PIE process on x86][x86-layout-pie]
[x86-layout-pie]: [[!!images/memory-layout-pie-v2.svg]] "Memory layout of a PIE process on Linux x86 with ASLR."

With a PIE process, the value in the symbol table is now an offset
from the base address.

    ::console
    $ readelf -s not-qemu-pie | sed -n -e 1,3p -e /command_to_handler/p
    
    Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 17 entries:
       Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
        47: 0000000000202080   256 OBJECT  LOCAL  DEFAULT   25 command_to_handler

If we look at `/proc/PID/maps`, we can figure out where the array is located in memory:

    ::console
    $ cat /proc/12593/maps
    7f6c13565000-7f6c13704000 r-xp 00000000 fd:01 9319  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so
    7f6c13704000-7f6c13904000 ---p 0019f000 fd:01 9319  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so
    7f6c13904000-7f6c13908000 r--p 0019f000 fd:01 9319  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so
    7f6c13908000-7f6c1390a000 rw-p 001a3000 fd:01 9319  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so
    7f6c1390a000-7f6c1390e000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
    7f6c1390e000-7f6c1392e000 r-xp 00000000 fd:01 5138  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.19.so
    7f6c13b2e000-7f6c13b2f000 r--p 00020000 fd:01 5138  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.19.so
    7f6c13b2f000-7f6c13b30000 rw-p 00021000 fd:01 5138  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.19.so
    7f6c13b30000-7f6c13b31000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
    7f6c13b31000-7f6c13b33000 r-xp 00000000 fd:04 4594  not-qemu-pie [text segment]
    7f6c13cf0000-7f6c13cf3000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
    7f6c13d2e000-7f6c13d32000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
    7f6c13d32000-7f6c13d33000 r--p 00001000 fd:04 4594  not-qemu-pie [data segment]
    7f6c13d33000-7f6c13d34000 rw-p 00002000 fd:04 4594  not-qemu-pie [BSS segment]
    [random gap]
    7f6c15c46000-7f6c15c67000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0     [heap]
    [random gap]
    7ffe823b0000-7ffe823d1000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0     [stack]

The base address is `0x7f6c13b31000`, the offset is `0x202080` and
therefore, the location of the array is `0x7f6c13d33080`. We can check
with `gdb`:

    ::console
    $ print &command_to_handler
    $1 = (uint8_t (*)[256]) 0x7f6c13d33080 <command_to_handler>

## Patching a memory spot

Once we know the location of the `command_to_handler[]` array in memory,
patching it is quite straightforward. First, we start tracing
the target process:

    ::c
    /* Attach to the running process */
    static int
    patch_attach(pid_t pid)
    {
        int status;
    
        printf("[.] Attaching to PID %d...\n", pid);
        if (ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, NULL, NULL) == -1) {
            fprintf(stderr, "[!] Unable to attach to PID %d: %m\n", pid);
            return -1;
        }
    
        if (waitpid(pid, &status, 0) == -1) {
            fprintf(stderr, "[!] Error while attaching to PID %d: %m\n", pid);
            return -1;
        }
        assert(WIFSTOPPED(status)); /* Tracee may have died */
    
        if (ptrace(PTRACE_GETSIGINFO, pid, NULL, &si) == -1) {
            fprintf(stderr, "[!] Unable to read siginfo for PID %d: %m\n", pid);
            return -1;
        }
        assert(si.si_signo == SIGSTOP); /* Other signals may have been received */
    
        printf("[*] Successfully attached to PID %d\n", pid);
        return 0;
    }

Then, we retrieve the `command_to_handler[]` array, modify it and put it
back in memory.[^write]

    ::c
    static int
    patch_doit(pid_t pid, unsigned char *target)
    {
        int ret = -1;
        unsigned char *command_to_handler = NULL;
        size_t i;
    
        /* Get the table */
        printf("[.] Retrieving command_to_handler table...\n");
        command_to_handler = ptrace_read(pid,
                                         target,
                                         QEMU_COMMAND_TO_HANDLER_SIZE);
        if (command_to_handler == NULL) {
            fprintf(stderr, "[!] Unable to read command_to_handler table: %m\n");
            goto out;
        }
    
        /* Check if the table has already been patched. */
        /* [...] */
    
        /* Patch it */
        printf("[.] Patching QEMU...\n");
        for (i = 0; i < QEMU_COMMAND_TO_HANDLER_SIZE; i++) {
            command_to_handler[i] = QEMU_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_HANDLER;
        }
        if (ptrace_write(pid, target, command_to_handler,
               QEMU_COMMAND_TO_HANDLER_SIZE) == -1) {
            fprintf(stderr, "[!] Unable to patch command_to_handler table: %m\n");
            goto out;
        }
        printf("[*] QEMU successfully patched!\n");
        ret = 0;
    
    out:
        free(command_to_handler);
        return ret;
    }

[^write]: Being an uninitialized static variable, the variable is in
          the BSS section. This section is mapped to a writable memory
          segment. If it wasn't the case, with Linux, the `ptrace()`
          system call is still allowed to write. Linux will copy the
          page and mark it as private.

Since `ptrace()` only allows one to read or write a word at a time,
`ptrace_read()` and `ptrace_write()` are wrappers to read or write
arbitrary large chunks of memory.[^vmreadv] Here is the code for
`ptrace_read()`:

    ::c
    /* Read memory of the given process */
    static void *
    ptrace_read(pid_t pid, void *address, size_t size)
    {
        /* Allocate the buffer */
        uword_t *buffer = malloc((size/sizeof(uword_t) + 1)*sizeof(uword_t));
        if (!buffer) return NULL;
    
        /* Read word by word */
        size_t readsz = 0;
        do {
            errno = 0;
            if ((buffer[readsz/sizeof(uword_t)] =
                    ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKTEXT, pid,
                           (unsigned char*)address + readsz,
                           0)) && errno) {
                fprintf(stderr, "[!] Unable to peek one word at address %p: %m\n",
                        (unsigned char *)address + readsz);
                free(buffer);
                return NULL;
            }
            readsz += sizeof(uword_t);
        } while (readsz < size);
        return (unsigned char *)buffer;
    }

[^vmreadv]: With Linux 3.2 or later, `process_vm_readv()`
            and `process_vm_writev()` can be used to transfer data from/to
            a remote process without using `ptrace()` at all. However,
            `ptrace()` would still be needed to reliably stop the main
            thread.

## Putting the pieces together

The patcher is provided with the following information:

 - the PID of the process to be patched,
 - the `command_to_handler[]` offset from the symbol table, and
 - the build ID of the executable file used to get this offset (as a safety measure).

The main steps are:

 1. **Attach to the process** with `ptrace()`.
 2. **Get the executable name** from `/proc/PID/exe`.
 3. Parse `/proc/PID/maps` to **find the address of the text segment** (it's the first one).
 4. Do some **sanity checks**:
      - check there is a ELF header at this location (4-byte magic number),
      - check the executable type (`ET_EXEC` for regular executables, `ET_DYN` for PIE), and
      - get the build ID and compare with the expected one.
 5. From the base address and the provided offset, **compute the location of the `command_to_handler[]` array**.
 6. **Patch** it.
