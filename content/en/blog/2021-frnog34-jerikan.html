Here are the slides I presented for [FRnOG #34][] in October 2021.
They are about automating the deployment of Blade's datacenters using
[Jerikan][] and [Ansible][]. For more information, have a look at
"[Jerikan+Ansible: a configuration management system for
network][post]."

The presentation, in French, was recorded. I have added English
subtitles.[^diction]

[^diction]: Good thing if you don't understand French as my diction
    was poor with a lot of fillers.
