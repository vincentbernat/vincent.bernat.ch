title: "Hacking the Geberit Sigma 70 flush plate"
description: |
   The Geberit Sigma 70 flush plate is very temperamental. I propose a simple
   trick to make it more reliable. Without guarantee.

My toilet is equipped with a [Geberit Sigma 70][] flush plate. The sales pitch
for this [hydraulic-assisted device][asservissement hydraulique] praises the
"ingenious mount that acts like a rocker switch." In practice, the flush is very
capricious and has a very high failure rate. **Avoid this type of
mechanism!** Prefer a fully mechanical version like the [Geberit Sigma 20][].

After several plumbers, exchanges with Geberit's technical department, and the
expensive replacement of the entire mechanism, I was still getting a failure rate
of over 50% for the small flush. I finally managed to decrease this rate to 5%
by applying two [8 mm silicone bumpers][amazon] on the back of the plate. Their
locations are indicated by red circles on the picture below:

Expect to pay about 5 â‚¬ and as many minutes for this operation.
