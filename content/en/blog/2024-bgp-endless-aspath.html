Combining [BGP confederations][rfc3065] and [AS override][] can potentially
create a BGP routing loop, resulting in an indefinitely expanding AS path.

**BGP confederation** is a technique used to reduce the number of iBGP sessions
and improve scalability in large autonomous systems (AS). It divides an AS into
sub-ASes. Most eBGP rules apply between sub-ASes, except that next-hop, MED, and
local preferences remain unchanged. The AS path length ignores contributions
from confederation sub-ASes. BGP confederation is rarely used and [BGP route
reflection][rfc4456] is typically preferred for scaling.

**AS override** is a feature that allows a router to replace the ASN of a
neighbor in the AS path of outgoing BGP routes with its own. It's useful when
two distinct autonomous systems share the same ASN. However, it interferes with
BGP's loop prevention mechanism and should be used cautiously. A safer
alternative is the `allowas-in` directive.[^allowconfedas-in]

[^allowconfedas-in]: When using BGP confederations with Cisco IOS XR, use
    `allowconfedas-in` instead. It's available since [IOS XR 7.11][].

In the example below, we have four routers in a single confederation, each in
its own sub-AS. `R0` originates the `2001:db8::1/128` prefix. `R1`, `R2`, and
`R3` forward this prefix to the next router in the loop.

![BGP routing loop involving 4 routers: R0 originates a prefix, R1, R2, R3 make
it loop using next-hop-self and as-override]([[!!images/bgp-loop.svg]] "BGP
routing loop using a confederation")

The router configurations are available in a [Git repository][]. They are
running Cisco IOS XR. `R2` uses the following configuration for BGP:

```cisco hl_lines="21 22 23"
router bgp 64502
 bgp confederation peers
  64500
  64501
  64503
 !
 bgp confederation identifier 64496
 bgp router-id 1.0.0.2
 address-family ipv6 unicast
 !
 neighbor 2001:db8::2:0
  remote-as 64501
  description R1
  address-family ipv6 unicast
  !
 !
 neighbor 2001:db8::3:1
  remote-as 64503
  advertisement-interval 0
  description R3
  address-family ipv6 unicast
   next-hop-self
   as-override
  !
 !
!
```

The session with `R3` uses both `as-override` and `next-hop-self` directives.
The latter is only necessary to make the announced prefix valid, as there is no
IGP in this example.[^igp]

[^igp]: Using BGP confederations is already inadvisable. If you don't use the
    same IGP for all sub-ASes, you're inviting trouble! However, the scenario
    described here is also possible with an IGP.

Here's the sequence of events leading to an infinite AS path:

1. `R0` sends the prefix to `R1` with AS path `(64500)`.[^confed]

1. `R1` selects it as the best path, forwarding it to `R2` with AS
   path `(64501 64500)`.

1. `R2` selects it as the best path, forwarding it to `R3` with AS
   path `(64500 64501 64502)`.

1. `R3` selects it as the best path. It would forward it to `R1` with AS path
   `(64503 64502 64501 64500)`, but due to AS override, it substitutes `R1`'s
   ASN with its own, forwarding it with AS path `(64503 64502 64503 64500)`.

1. `R1` accepts the prefix, as its own ASN is not in the AS path. It compares
   this new prefix with the one from `R0`. Both `(64500)` and `(64503 64502
   64503 64500)` have the same length because confederation sub-ASes don't
   contribute to AS path length. **The first tie-breaker is the router ID**.
   `R0`'s router ID (`1.0.0.4`) is higher than `R3`'s (`1.0.0.3`). The new
   prefix becomes the best path and is forwarded to `R2` with AS path `(64501
   64503 64501 64503 64500)`.

1. `R2` receives the new prefix, replacing the old one. It selects it as the
   best path and forwards it to `R3` with AS path `(64502 64501 64502 64501
   64502 64500)`.

1. `R3` receives the new prefix, replacing the old one. It selects it as the
   best path and forwards it to `R0` with AS path `(64503 64502 64503 64502
   64503 64502 64500)`.

1. `R1` receives the new prefix, replacing the old one. Again, it competes with
   the prefix from `R0`, and again the new prefix wins due to the lower router
   ID. The prefix is forwarded to `R2` with AS path `(64501 64503 64501 64503
   64501 64503 64501 64500)`.

[^confed]: When an AS path segment is composed of ASNs from a confederation, it
    is displayed between parentheses.

A few iterations later, `R1` views the looping prefix as follows:[^pacing]

[^pacing]: By default, IOS XR paces eBGP updates. This is controlled by the
    `advertisement-interval` directive. Its default value is 30 seconds for eBGP
    peers (even in the same confederation). `R1` and `R2` set this value to 0,
    while `R3` sets it to 2 seconds. This gives some time to watch the AS path
    grow.

There's no upper bound for an AS path, but BGP messages have size limits (4096
bytes per [RFC 4271][rfc4271] or 65535 bytes per [RFC 8654][rfc8654]). At some
point, BGP updates can't be generated. On Cisco IOS XR, the BGP process crashes
well before reaching this limit.[^ddts]

[^ddts]: This is [CSCwk15887][]. It only happens when using `as-override` on an
    AS path with a too long `AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE`. This should be fixed around
    24.3.1.

The main lessons from this tale are:

- never use BGP confederations under any circumstances, and
- be cautious of features that weaken BGP routing loop detection.
