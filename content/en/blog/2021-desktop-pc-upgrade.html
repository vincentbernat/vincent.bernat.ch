I built my current desktop PC in 2014. A second SSD was added in 2015.
The motherboard and the power supply were replaced after a
fault[^fault] in 2016. The memory was upgraded in
2018. A discrete AMD GPU was installed in 2019 to drive [two 4K
screens][]. An NVMe disk was added earlier this year to further
increase storage performance. This is a testament to the durability of
a desktop PC compared to a laptop: it's evolutive and you can keep it
a long time.

[^fault]: The original power supply was from an older configuration.
    It suddenly became unable to reliably start the PC. The
    motherboard got replaced as it was the first suspect: without
    load, the power supply was working correctly.

While fine for most usage, the CPU started to become a bottleneck
during video conferences.[^acceleration] So, it was set for an
upgrade. The table below summarizes the change. This update cost me
about 800 €.

[^acceleration]: On Linux, many programs are unable to leverage hardware
    acceleration. This is a pity. On a laptop, this can also draws the
    battery pretty fast.

According to [some benchmark][], the new CPU should be 4× faster when
all cores are used and 1.5× faster for a single-threaded workload.
Compiling an arbitrary kernel provides a 3× speedup. Before:
