Started in 2008, [lldpd][] is an implementation of
[IEEE 802.1AB-2005][] (aka LLDP) written in C. While it contains some
unit tests, like many other network-related software at the time, their
coverage is pretty poor: they are hard to write because the
code is written in an imperative style and tighly coupled with the
system. It would require extensive mocking.[^cwrap] While a rewrite
(complete or iterative) would help to make the code more
test-friendly, it would be quite an effort and it will likely
introduce operational bugs along the way.

[^cwrap]: A project like [cwrap][] would definitely help. However, it
          lacks support for Netlink and raw sockets that are essential
          in *lldpd* operations.

To get better test coverage, the major features of *lldpd* are now
verified through **integration tests**. These tests leverage Linux
**network namespaces** to setup a lightweight and isolated environment
for each test. They run through **pytest**, a powerful testing tool.

# pytest in a nutshell

[pytest][] is a Python testing tool whose primary use is to write
tests for Python applications but is versatile enough for other
creative usages. It is bundled with three killer features:

 - you can directly use the `assert` keyword,
 - you can **inject fixtures** in any test function, and
 - you can **parametrize** tests.

## Assertions

With [unittest][], the unit testing framework included with Python,
and many similar frameworks, unit tests have to be encapsulated into a
class and use the provided assertion methods. For example:

    ::python
    class testArithmetics(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_addition(self):
            self.assertEqual(1 + 3, 4)

The equivalent with *pytest* is simpler and more readable:

    ::python
    def test_addition():
        assert 1 + 3 == 4

*pytest* will analyze the AST and display useful error messages in
case of failure. For further information, see
[Benjamin Peterson's article][].

## Fixtures

A *fixture* is the set of actions performed in order to prepare the
system to run some tests. With classic frameworks, you can only
define one fixture for a set of tests:

    ::python
    class testInVM(unittest.TestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            self.vm = VM('Test-VM')
            self.vm.start()
            self.ssh = SSHClient()
            self.ssh.connect(self.vm.public_ip)

        def tearDown(self):
            self.ssh.close()
            self.vm.destroy()

        def test_hello(self):
            stdin, stdout, stderr = self.ssh.exec_command("echo hello")
            stdin.close()
            self.assertEqual(stderr.read(), b"")
            self.assertEqual(stdout.read(), b"hello\n")

In the example above, we want to test various commands on a remote
VM. The fixture launches a new VM and configure an SSH
connection. However, if the SSH connection cannot be established, the
fixture will fail and the `tearDown()` method won't be invoked. The VM
will be left running.

Instead, with *pytest*, we could do this:

    ::python
    @pytest.yield_fixture
    def vm():
        r = VM('Test-VM')
        r.start()
        yield r
        r.destroy()

    @pytest.yield_fixture
    def ssh(vm):
        ssh = SSHClient()
        ssh.connect(vm.public_ip)
        yield ssh
        ssh.close()

    def test_hello(ssh):
        stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command("echo hello")
        stdin.close()
        stderr.read() == b""
        stdout.read() == b"hello\n"

The first fixture will provide a freshly booted VM. The second one
will setup an SSH connection to the VM provided as an
argument. Fixtures are used through **dependency injection**: just
give their names in the signature of the test functions and fixtures
that need them. Each fixture only handle the lifetime of one
entity. Whatever a dependent test function or fixture succeeds or
fails, the VM will always be finally destroyed.

## Parameters

If you want to run the same test several times with a varying
parameter, you can dynamically create test functions or use one test
function with a loop. With *pytest*, you can **parametrize** test
functions and fixtures:

    ::python
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("n1, n2, expected", [
        (1, 3, 4),
        (8, 20, 28),
        (-4, 0, -4)])
    def test_addition(n1, n2, expected):
        assert n1 + n2 == expected

# Testing lldpd

The general plan for to test a feature in *lldpd* is the following:

 1. Setup **two namespaces**.
 2. Create a **virtual link** between them.
 3. Spawn a **`lldpd` process** in each namespace.
 4. **Test** the feature in one namespace.
 5. Check with `lldpcli` we get the **expected result** in the other.

Here is a typical test using the most interesting features of *pytest*:

    ::python
    @pytest.mark.skipif('LLDP-MED' not in pytest.config.lldpd.features,
                        reason="LLDP-MED not supported")
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("classe, expected", [
        (1, "Generic Endpoint (Class I)"),
        (2, "Media Endpoint (Class II)"),
        (3, "Communication Device Endpoint (Class III)"),
        (4, "Network Connectivity Device")])
    def test_med_devicetype(lldpd, lldpcli, namespaces, links,
                            classe, expected):
        links(namespaces(1), namespaces(2))
        with namespaces(1):
            lldpd("-r")
        with namespaces(2):
            lldpd("-M", str(classe))
        with namespaces(1):
            out = lldpcli("-f", "keyvalue", "show", "neighbors", "details")
            assert out['lldp.eth0.lldp-med.device-type'] == expected

First, the test will be executed only if `lldpd` was compiled with
LLDP-MED support. Second, the test is parametrized. We will execute
four distinct tests, one for each role that `lldpd` should be able to
take as an LLDP-MED-enabled endpoint.

The signature of the test has four parameters that are not covered by
the `parametrize()` decorator: `lldpd`, `lldpcli`, `namespaces` and
`links`. They are *fixtures*. A lot of magic happen in them to keep
the actual tests short:

 - `lldpd` is a factory to spawn an instance of `lldpd`. When called,
   it will setup the current namespace (setting up the chroot,
   creating the user and group for privilege separation, replacing
   some files to be distribution-agnostic, ...), then call `lldpd`
   with the additional parameters provided. The output is recorded and
   added to the test report in case of failure. The module also
   contains the creation of the `pytest.config.lldpd` object that is
   used to record the features supported by `lldpd` and skip
   non-matching tests. You can read
   [`fixtures/programs.py`][programs.py] for more details.

 - `lldpcli` is also a factory, but it spawns instances of `lldpcli`,
   the client to query `lldpd`. Moreover, it will parse the output in
   a dictionary to reduce boilerplate.

 - `namespaces` is one of the most interesting pieces. It is a
   **factory for Linux namespaces**. It will spawn a new namespace or
   refer to an existing one. It is possible to switch from one namespace
   to another (with `with`) as they are contexts. Behind the scene,
   the factory maintains the appropriate file descriptors for each
   namespace and switch to them with `setns()`. Once the test is done,
   everything is wipped out as the file descriptors are garbage
   collected. You can read [`fixtures/namespaces.py`][namespaces.py]
   for more details. It is quite reusable in other
   projects.[^limitations]

 - `links` contains helpers to handle network interfaces: creation of
   virtual ethernet link between namespaces, creation of bridges,
   bonds and VLAN, etc. It relies on the [pyroute2][] module. You can
   read [`fixtures/network.py`][network.py] for more details.

[^limitations]: There are three main limitations in the use of
                namespaces with this fixture. First, when creating a
                user namespace, only root is mapped to the current
                user. With *lldpd*, we have two users (`root` and
                `_lldpd`). Therefore, the tests have to run as root.
                The second limitation is with the PID namespace. It's
                not possible for a process to switch from one PID
                namespace to another. When you call `setns()` on a PID
                namespace, only children of the current process will
                be in the new PID namespace. The PID namespace is
                convenient to ensure everyone gets killed once the
                tests are terminated but you must keep in mind that
                `/proc` must be mounted in children only. The third
                limitation is that, for some namespaces (PID and
                user), all threads of a process must be part of the
                same namespace. Therefore, don't use threads in
                tests. Use `multiprocessing` module instead.

You can see an example of a test run on the
[Travis build for 0.9.2][]. Since each test is correctly isolated,
it's possible to run parallel tests with `pytest -n 10 --boxed`. To
catch even more bugs, both the **address sanitizer** (ASAN) and the
**undefined behavior sanitizer** (UBSAN) are enabled. In case of a
problem, notably a memory leak, the faulty program will exit with a
non-zero exit code and the associated test will fail.
