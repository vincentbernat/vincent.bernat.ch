title: "Self-hosted videos with HLS"
description: |
  Putting videos on YouTube is a convenient solution, but not a
  privacy-friendly one. Using HLS, it's possible to self-host
  videos while being bandwidth-friendly.

Hosting videos on [YouTube][] is convenient for several reasons:
pretty good player, free bandwidth, mobile-friendly, network effect
<del>and, at your discretion, no ads</del>.[^ads] On the other hand, this is one
of the less privacy-friendly solution. Most other providers
share the same characteristics—except the ability to disable ads for
free.

[^ads]: [YouTube will now show ads on all videos even if creators
    don't want them][].

With the [`<video>` tag][video], self-hosting a video is
simple:[^formats]

    ::html
    <video controls>
      <source src="../videos/big_buck_bunny.webm" type="video/webm">
      <source src="../videos/big_buck_bunny.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>

[^formats]: Nowadays, everything supports MP4/H.264. It usually also
    brings hardware acceleration, which improves battery life on
    mobile devices. WebM/VP9 provides a better quality at the same
    bitrate.

However, while it is possible to provide a [different videos depending
on the screen width][], **adapting the video to the available
bandwidth** is trickier. There are two solutions:

 - HLS ([RFC 8216][]), and
 - MPEG-DASH ([ISO/IEC 23009-1:2014][]).

They are both **adaptive bitrate streaming protocols**: the video is
sliced in small segments and made available at a variety of different
bitrates. Depending on current network conditions, the player
automatically selects the appropriate bitrate to download the next
segment.

*HLS* was initially implemented by Apple but is now also supported
natively by Microsoft Edge and Chrome on Android. [hls.js][] is a
JavaScript library bringing HLS support to other browsers. *MPEG-DASH*
is technically superior (codec-agnostic) but only works through a
JavaScript library, like [dash.js][]. In both cases, support of the
[Media Source Extensions][] is needed when native support is
absent. Safari on iOS [doesn't have this feature][caniuse] and cannot
use *MPEG-DASH*. Consequently, the most compatible solution is
currently *HLS*.

# Encoding

To serve HLS videos, you need three kinds of files:

 - the **media segments** (encoded with different bitrates/resolutions),
 - a **media playlist** for each variant, listing the media segments, and
 - a **master playlist**, listing the media playlists.

Media segments can come in two formats:

 - MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS), or
 - Fragmented MP4.

Fragmented MP4 media segments are supported since iOS 10. They are a
bit more efficient and can be reused to serve the same content as
MPEG-DASH (only the playlists are different). Also, they can be served
from the same file with range requests. However, if you want to
target older versions of iOS, you need to stick with MPEG-2 TS.[^both]

[^both]: You could generate both formats and use them as variants in
    the master playlist. However, a [limitation in
    *hls.js*][issue1510] prevents this option.

[FFmpeg][] is able to convert a video to media segments and generate
the associated media playlists. [Peer5's documentation][] explains the
suitable commands. I have put together a handy (Python 3.6) script,
[video2hls][], stitching together all the steps. After executing it on
your target video, you get a directory containing:

 - media segments for each resolution (`1080p_1_001.ts`, `720p_2_001.ts`, ...)
 - media playlists for each resolution (`1080p_1.m3u8`, `720p_2.m3u8`, ...)
 - master playlist (`index.m3u8`)
 - progressive (streamable) MP4 version of your video (`progressive.mp4`)
 - poster (`poster.jpg`)

The script accepts a lot of options for customization. Use the
`--help` flag to discover them. Run it with `--debug` to get the
`ffmpeg` commands executed with an explanation for each flag. For
example, the poster is built with this command:

    ::sh
    ffmpeg \
      `# seek to the given position (5%)` \
       -ss 4 \
      `# load input file` \
       -i ../2018-self-hosted-videos.mp4 \
      `# take only one frame` \
       -frames:v 1 \
      `# filter to select an I-frame and scale` \
       -vf 'select=eq(pict_type\,I),scale=1280:720' \
      `# request a JPEG quality ~ 10` \
       -qscale:v 28 \
      `# output file` \
       poster.jpg

# Serving

We got a bunch of static files we can upload anywhere. Yet two details
are important:

 - When serving from another domain, [CORS][] needs to be configured
   to allow `GET` requests. Adding `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to
   response headers is enough.[^cors]
 - Some clients may be picky about the MIME types. Ensure files are
   served with the ones in the table below.

Kind              | Extension | MIME type
----------------- | --------- | --------------
Playlists         | `.m3u8`   | `application/vnd.apple.mpegurl`
MPEG2-TS segments | `.ts`     | `video/mp2t`
fMP4 segments     | `.mp4`    | `video/mp4`
Progressive MP4   | `.mp4`    | `video/mp4`
Poster            | `.jpg`    | `image/jpeg`

[^cors]: Use `https://example.org` instead of the wildcard character
    to restrict access to your own domain.

Let's host our files on [Exoscale's Object Storage][] which is
compatible with S3 and located in Switzerland. As an example, the
[*Caminandes 3: Llamigos*][video] video is about 213 MiB (five sizes for
HLS and one progressive MP4). It would cost us less than 0.01 € per month
for storage and 1.42 € for bandwidth if 1000 people watch the 1080p
version from beginning to end—unlikely.[^cdn]

[^cdn]: There is no need to host these files behind a (costly)
    CDN. Latency doesn't matter much as long as you can sustain the
    appropriate bandwidth.

We use `s3cmd` to upload files. First, you need to recover your [API
credentials][] from the portal and put them in `~/.s3cfg`:

    ::ini
    [default]
    host_base = sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io
    host_bucket = %(bucket)s.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io
    access_key = EXO.....
    secret_key = ....
    use_https = True
    bucket_location = ch-dk-2

The second step is to create a bucket:

    ::console
    $ s3cmd mb s3://hls-videos
    Bucket 's3://hls-videos/' created

You need to configure the CORS policy for this bucket. First, define
the policy in a `cors.xml` file (you may want to restrict the allowed
origin):

    ::xml
    <CORSConfiguration>
     <CORSRule>
       <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
       <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
     </CORSRule>
    </CORSConfiguration>

Then, apply it to the bucket:

    ::console
    $ s3cmd setcors cors.xml s3://hls-videos

The last step is to copy the static files. Playlists are served
compressed to save a bit of bandwidth. For each video, inside the
directory containing all the generated files, use the following
command:

    ::sh
    while read extension mime gz; do
      [ -z "$gz" ] || {
        # gzip compression (if not already done)
        for f in *.${extension}; do
          ! gunzip -t $f 2> /dev/null || continue
          gzip $f
          mv $f.gz $f
        done
      }
      s3cmd --no-preserve -F -P \
            ${gz:+--add-header=Content-Encoding:gzip} \
            --mime-type=${mime} \
            --encoding=UTF-8 \
            --exclude=* --include=*.${extension} \
            --delete-removed \
        sync . s3://hls-videos/video1/
    done <<EOF
    m3u8  application/vnd.apple.mpegurl true
    jpg   image/jpeg
    mp4   video/mp4
    ts    video/mp2t
    EOF

The files are now available at
`https://hls-videos.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io/video1/`.

# HTML

We can insert our video in a document with the following markup:

    ::html
    <video poster="https://hls-videos.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io/video1/poster.jpg"
           controls preload="none">
      <source src="https://hls-videos.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io/video1/index.m3u8"
              type="application/vnd.apple.mpegurl">
      <source src="https://hls-videos.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io/video1/progressive.mp4"
              type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.4d401f, mp4a.40.2"'>
    </video>

Browsers with native support use the HLS version while others would
fall back to the progressive MP4 version. However, with the help of
[hls.js][], we can ensure most browsers benefit from the HLS version
too:

    ::html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@latest"></script>
    <script>
        if(Hls.isSupported()) {
            var selector = "video source[type='application/vnd.apple.mpegurl']",
                videoSources = document.querySelectorAll(selector);
            videoSources.forEach(function(videoSource) {
                var m3u8 = videoSource.src,
                    once = false;

                // Clone the video to remove any source
                var oldVideo = videoSource.parentNode,
                    newVideo = oldVideo.cloneNode(false);

                // Replace video tag with our clone.
                oldVideo.parentNode.replaceChild(newVideo, oldVideo);

                // Add an empty source (enable play event on Chromium 72+)
                newVideo.src = "about:blank";

                // On play, initialize hls.js, once.
                newVideo.addEventListener('play',function() {
                    if (once) return;
                    once = true;

                    var hls = new Hls({ capLevelToPlayerSize: true });
                    hls.loadSource(m3u8);
                    hls.attachMedia(newVideo);
                    hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, function() {
                        newVideo.play();
                    });
                }, false);
            });
        }
    </script>

!!! "Update (2018-12)" Starting from Chromium 72, a video without a
source (like built with the snippet above) cannot trigger a play event
anymore. Therefore, we use a dummy source using `about:blank`.

Here is the result, featuring [*Caminandes 3: Llamigos*][video], a
video created by Pablo Vasquez, produced by the [Blender Foundation][]
and released under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0][] license:

Most JavaScript attributes, methods and events work just like with a
plain `<video>` element. For example, you can seek to an arbitrary
position, like [1:00](#video-seek-60) or [2:00](#video-seek-120)<span
class="when-nojs">—but you would need to enable JavaScript to
test</span>.

The player is different from one browser to another but provides the
basic needs. You can upgrade to a more advanced player, like
[video.js][] or [MediaElements.js][]. They also handle HLS videos
through *hls.js*.

!!! "Update" For subtitles, have a look at "[Self-hosted videos with
HLS: subtitles][]."

**Hosting your videos on *YouTube* is not unavoidable**: serving them
yourself while offering quality delivery is technically affordable. If
bandwidth requirements are modest and the network effect not
important, self-hosting makes it possible to regain control of the
published content and not to turn over readers to Google. In the same
spirit, [PeerTube][] offers a video sharing platform. Decentralized
and federated, it relies on BitTorrent to reduce bandwidth
requirements.

# Addendum

## Preloading

In the above example, `preload="none"` was used for two reasons:

 - Most readers won't play the video as it is an addon to the main
   content. Therefore, bandwidth is not wasted by downloading a few
   segments of video, at the expense of slightly increased latency on
   play.
 - We do not want non-native HLS clients to start downloading the
   non-HLS version while *hls.js* is loading and taking over the
   video. This could also be done by declaring the progressive MP4
   fallback from JavaScript, but this would make the video unplayable
   for users without JavaScript. If preloading is important, you can
   remove the `preload` attribute from JavaScript—and not wait for
   the play event to initialize *hls.js*.

## CSP

Setting up [CSP][] correctly can be quite a pain. For browsers with
native HLS support, you need the following policy, in addition to your
existing policy:

 - `image-src https://hls-videos.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io` for the posters,
 - `media-src https://hls-videos.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io` for the playlists and
   media segments.

With *hls.js*, things are more complex. Ideally, the following
policy should also be applied:

 - `worker-src blob:` for the transmuxing web worker,
 - `media-src blob: about:` for the transmuxed segments,
 - `connect-src https://hls-videos.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io` to
   fetch playlists and media segments from JavaScript.

However, `worker-src` is quite [recent][worker-src]. The expected
fallbacks are `child-src` ([deprecated][child-src]), `script-src` (but
[not everywhere][script-src]) and then `default-src`. Therefore, for
broader compatibility, you also need to append `blob:` to
`default-src` as well as to `script-src` and `child-src` if you
already have them. Here is an example policy—assuming the original
policy was just `default-src 'self'` and media, XHR and workers were
not needed:

    ::http
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Content-Security-Policy: 
      default-src 'self' blob:;
      image-src 'self' https://hls-videos.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io;
      media-src blob: about: https://hls-videos.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io;
      connect-src https://hls-videos.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io;
      worker-src blob:;
