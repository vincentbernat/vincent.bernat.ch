I was hosting my [projects][1] on several
[Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) instances on a dedicated
server. However, since several months, spam was pourring.

# Trac & spam

## How to fight spam with Trac

There is not built-in mechanism in Trac to fight spam. However, 
[plugins](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/SpamFilter) enable to setup
several ways to stop spam (or at least, reduce it).

One of them is [Akismet](http://akismet.com/), a web service
who can tell you if some message is a spam or not. It is able to catch
most of the spam. A bayesian filter complement this service. A
learning step is mandatory and can become cumbersome when the vast
majority of the tickets you receive is just spam. I used those two
mechanisms on my Trac instances.

Another path is to require an account to post a ticket. Creating an
account each time you want to create a ticket for some software is
burdensome. I did not want to do this to the poor souls that have
found a bug in one of my projects. An alternative is to setup a public
account and adding somewhere in the page some instructions on how to
use it when you want to open a ticket but don't want to open an account.

## Removing spam

Despite Akismet and the bayesian filter, I still got two or three
spams a day. I catched them in my RSS flow or in my email if they were
not classified as spam.

There are two steps to remove the spam:

 * tell the bayesian filter by using the administration panel in the
   web interface,
 * remove the spam from the database using some SQLite commands
   directly on the server hosting the Trac instance.

Indeed, Trac does not propose the possibility to remove a ticket. Of
course, there are plugins, but you must find them, install them, find
how to configure them, etc.

Cumbersome.

# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a popular source code hosting service
which uses [Git](http://git-scm.com/) as a backend. This is a
proprietary platform but a lot of open source projects have migrated
to it, thanks to its features and the good performances.

Everybody is on GitHub. This was the ideal opportunity.

**UPDATED:** [Peter Pentchev](http://twitter.com/mrrmot) did point me
to [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org) which is a free alternative to
GitHub. Its source code is licensed under the
[AGPL][agpl]. Unfortunately, I did not consider it because it was
lacking an issue tracker.

## Features

First, GitHub allows you to host Git repository. You push your Git
repositories. There is a nice and fast web interface to browse
them. However, I still keep an instance of
[cgit](http://cgit.luffy.cx).

Then, GitHub is very popular because they drive people to fork
projects. With one single click, you can fork your favorite
project. You get a copy which is synchronised with the forked project.

There is also a wiki (accepting many markup syntaxes). This wiki is
also available through Git.

At last, GitHub offers a minimalistic ticket system. You open a
ticket, you make some comments, you can add a tag or two and you can
close it. That's all. Quite light. But enough for small projects like
mine.

However, there is more! Do not open a ticket to send a patch. There is
no way to attach files to tickets. You need to fork the project,
create a branch with your patch and request a "pull" for your
branch. This will appear as a ticket but your commits will be linked
to it. The author can then review and comment your branch, ask for
some changes and if they want to integrate it, a simple merge is
sufficient. They can even do it using the web interface. Convenient.

Socially, you can comment commits, tickets, projects and subscribe to
a lot of events. You can receive and answers tickets by mail.

However, an accound is mandatory to open a ticket. Since there is a
lot of projects on GitHub, this account should be useful for a lot of
software.

To cut a long story short, even if GitHub is a proprietary platform,
it offers nice and interesting features. More and more projects
migrate from [Google Code](http://code.google.com) to GitHub even if
there is less features on the latter.

## Migration

I have searched for tools to migrate automatically tickets from Trac
to GitHub. For example, there is [SD](http://syncwith.us/sd/).

**UPDATED:** [Olivier Berger](http://www-public.it-sudparis.eu/~berger_o)
is involved into [ForgePlucker](http://home.gna.org/forgeplucker/), a
project aimed to provide tools to import and export data for various
forges.

At last, I have done it manually. GitHub API is well documented and
there exists bindings in various languages including Python but it is
a very limited API. You can't choose the number of the ticket nor its
date.

I have also rewritten `README` files to use the markdown markup and
avoid the use of wiki pages when possible.

I have also put some URL redirections with the help of nginx.

In conclusion, even if maintaining Trac instances was not a lot of
work, one thing that I do not have to do anymore. And no spam on
GitHub, I assume.
