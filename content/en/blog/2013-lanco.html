!!! "Update (2021-07)" *lanĉo* does not work with *cgroups v2*, which
are now enabled by default on modern distributions. There is no plan
to update it. A good alternative is [systemd-run][].

A few months ago, I was looking for a piece of software to spawn
**long-running tasks** on behalf of some daemon with the benefit of
the tasks not being interrupted when this daemon is restarted. Here
are the specifications:

 - No special privilege is needed to submit a task.
 - Submitted tasks are not known beforehand.
 - Task output is redirected to a log file.
 - Submitted tasks are identified by a provided name.
 - With only the name as a reference, a task can be checked for
   existence or killed.
 - Tasks should not be interrupted by an unrelated event, like a
   configuration change or a software upgrade.

The last requirement explains why tasks are not spawned directly by
the daemon requesting them: its complexity or the way it needs to be
operated may need frequent restarts. Even if it is possible to
re-execute a daemon while keeping its children, like
[stateful re-exec support in _Upstart_][], this is quite difficult:
internal state should be serialized and restored. Part of this state
can be contained into a third-party library.

While [Upstart][] or [systemd][] seemed to be good candidates for this
purpose, I didn't find a straightforward way to run arbitrary tasks
without any privilege.[^user]

[^user]: Both _systemd_ and _Upstart_ are difficult to run without
         being PID 1 and without being _root_. They both support user
         sessions but this requires to use them as PID 1 as well. I
         discovered later that [runit][] would have been a good fit:
         it does not require to be PID 1, it does not need to be run
         as _root_ and the service directory can be specified by an
         environment variable. It could have been tweaked to meet the
         above requirements.

Here comes [lanĉo][].[^name] It is a very simple task launcher. It can
run any tasks, stop them and check if they are still running. It
leverages [cgroups][] in recent Linux kernels and avoids the use of
any daemon.

[^name]: _Lanĉo_ means _launcher_ in esperanto. The command name could
    have been `lancxo`, but I wasn't aware of this at the time.

# Quick tour

Before looking at how [lanĉo][] works, let's have a look at how it can
be used. To avoid usage conflicts, each task is run in the context of
a namespace that needs to be initialized:

    ::console
    $ sudo lanco testns init -u $(id -un) -g $(id -gn)

This is the only command that needs to be run as _root_. Subsequent
ones can be run as a normal user. Let's run some task:

    ::console
    $ lanco testns run first-task openssl speed aes
    $ lanco testns check first-task && echo "Still running"
    Still running
    $ lanco testns ls
    testns
     ├ first-task
     │  → 28456 openssl speed aes
     ╯

The output of the task is logged into a file:

    ::console
    $ head -3 /var/log/lanco-testns/task-first-task.log
    Doing aes-128 cbc for 3s on 16 size blocks: 8678442 aes-128 cbc's in 2.85s
    Doing aes-128 cbc for 3s on 64 size blocks: 2478283 aes-128 cbc's in 2.99s
    Doing aes-128 cbc for 3s on 256 size blocks: 628105 aes-128 cbc's in 3.00s

If the task is too long, we can kill it:

    ::console
    $ lanco testns run first-task openssl speed aes
    $ lanco testns stop first-task

You cannot run a task that already exists or kill a task that does not
exist:

    ::console
    $ lanco testns run first-task openssl speed aes
    2013-06-09T22:50:34 [WARN/run] task first-task is already running
    $ lanco testns stop second-task
    2013-06-09T22:50:45 [WARN/stop] task second-task is not running

Thanks to the use of _cgroups_, _lanĉo_ is able to track multiple
processes even when they are forking away:[^forkbomb]

    ::console
    $ lanco testns run second-task sh -c \
    >  "while true; do (sleep 30 &)& sleep 1; done"
    $ lanco testns ls
    testns
     ├ first-task
     │  → 28456 openssl speed aes
     ├ second-task
     │  → 29572 sh -c while true; do (sleep 30 &)& sleep 1; done
     │  → 29575 sleep 30
     │  → 29593 sleep 30
     │  → 29596 sleep 30
     │  → 29599 sleep 30
     │  → 29622 sleep 30
     │  → 29644 sleep 1
     │  → 29645 sleep 30
     ╯
    $ lanco testns stop second-task
    $ lanco testns check second-task || echo "Killed!"
    Killed!

[^forkbomb]: Linux _cgroups_ do not provide any facility to kill a
             whole group. We need to iterate through the processes and
             kill them one by one. _lanĉo_ does not try to freeze
             processes before killing them and therefore may be
             inefficient against violent fork bombs.

Also, there is a `top`-like command (`lanco testns top`):

![lanco top][lanco-top]

# Using cgroups

Control groups (_cgroups_) is a mechanism to partition a set of tasks
and their future children into hierarchical groups with a set of
parameters.

## Hierarchy

Let's start with the hierarchical stuff first. To create a new
hierarchy, you have to mount the `cgroup` filesystem on some empty
directory. Usually, _cgroups_ hierarchies are setup in
`/sys/fs/cgroups` which is a `tmpfs` filesystem:

    ::console
    # mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /sys/fs/cgroup -o nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,mode=755

Now, we can create our first hierarchy:

    ::console
    # cd /sys/fs/cgroup
    # mkdir my-first-hierarchy
    # mount -t cgroup cgroup my-first-hierarchy -o name=my-first-hierarchy,none
    # ls -1 my-first-hierarchy
    cgroup.clone_children
    cgroup.event_control
    cgroup.procs
    notify_on_release
    release_agent
    tasks

We'll see later the purpose of `none`. The most interesting file is
`tasks`. It contains the PIDs of all processes in our group. Since
there are currently no sub-group, all processes are part of it. Let's
create a sub-group and attach a process to it:

    ::console
    # mkdir first-child
    # cd first-child
    # ls -1
    cgroup.clone_children
    cgroup.event_control
    cgroup.procs
    notify_on_release
    tasks
    # echo $$ > tasks
    # cat tasks
    23184
    23311
    # cat /proc/$$/cgroup
    9:name=my-first-hierarchy:/first-child
    8:perf_event:/
    7:blkio:/
    6:net_cls:/
    5:freezer:/
    4:devices:/
    3:cpuacct,cpu:/
    2:cpuset:/
    1:name=systemd:/user/bernat/1

We have added our shell to the new _cgroup_. Moreover, all its
children will also be part of this group. This explains why we have
two tasks: the shell and `cat`. The last command is quite interesting:
for each hierarchy, it shows which _cgroup_ the task belongs to. For a
given hierarchy, each task is exactly in one group.

The most useful features of _lanĉo_ are done using just this: a
namespace is a named hierarchy and each task is enclosed into a
_cgroup_ so it can be tracked properly.

## Subsystems

A _subsystem_ makes use of the task grouping provided by _cgroups_ to
assign resources to a set of tasks. Each available subsystem can only
be in one hierarchy, so the usual way to setup things is to assign a
hierarchy for each subsystem.[^cpu]

[^cpu]: The `cpu` and `cpuacct` subsystems are the notable
        exception. There seems to be little use to keep them in
        separate hierarchies, so they are part of the same hierarchy.

Let's have a look at the `cpuset` subsystem: it allows one to assign tasks
to specific CPUs and memory nodes (for NUMA systems). Let's suppose we
have 4 cores and we want to assign the first core to common system
tasks and the three remaining ones to _nginx_:

    ::console
    # cd /sys/fs/cgroup
    # mkdir cpuset
    # mount -t cgroup cgroup cpuset -o cpuset
    # echo 0-3 > cpuset/cpuset.cpus
    # echo 0 > cpuset/cpuset.mems

    # mkdir cpuset/system
    # echo 0 > cpuset/system/cpuset.cpus
    # echo 0 > cpuset/system/cpuset.mems
    # for task in $(cat cpuset/tasks); do
    >    echo $task > cpuset/system/tasks
    > done

    # mkdir cpuset/nginx
    # echo 1-3 > cpuset/nginx/cpuset.cpus
    # echo 0 > cpuset/nginx/cpuset.mems
    # for task in $(pidof nginx); do
    >    echo $task > cpuset/nginx/tasks
    > done

The first `mount` is not needed if something else (like _systemd_) has
setup the appropriate subsystem. Now, even if some system process is
going crazy, it won't affect the performance of your webserver.

The kernel comes with a [more complete documentation][cgroups.txt] if
you need additional details on _cgroups_. There are high level tools
to manipulate them, like the tools provided by [libcg][], but they are
currently quite buggy and invasive.

## Use in lanĉo

Here are the features used by _lanĉo_:

 - For each namespace, a specific named hierarchy is created.
 - By setting the appropriate permissions on the hierarchy, an
   unprivileged user can create subgroups.
 - Each submitted task has its own sub-group for tracking purpose.
 - Actions can be executed when a task terminates by using the
   _release agent_ mechanism.[^agent]
 - The `cpuacct` subsystem is used to track CPU usage: a group is
   created in this subsystem for this purpose.

[^agent]: Unfortunately, only one global release agent per hierarchy
          can be used. Since _lanĉo_ provides with the ability to
          execute an arbitrary command when a task terminates, the
          command needs to be stored on the filesystem for the release
          agent of the namespace to execute it.
