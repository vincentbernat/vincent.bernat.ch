  Invoking Zsh vcs_info function before rendering the prompt

  solves this issue.

[Zsh][] ships `vcs_info`, a function fetching information about the
VCS state for the current directory and populating a variable that can
be used in a shell prompt. It supports several VCS, including Git and
SVN. Here is an example of configuration:

    ::sh
    autoload -Uz vcs_info
    zstyle ':vcs_info:*' enable git

    () {
        local formats="${PRCH[branch]} %b%c%u"
        local actionformats="${formats}%{${fg[default]}%} ${PRCH[sep]} %{${fg[green]}%}%a"
        zstyle ':vcs_info:*:*' formats           $formats
        zstyle ':vcs_info:*:*' actionformats     $actionformats
        zstyle ':vcs_info:*:*' stagedstr         "%{${fg[green]}%}${PRCH[circle]}"
        zstyle ':vcs_info:*:*' unstagedstr       "%{${fg[yellow]}%}${PRCH[circle]}"
        zstyle ':vcs_info:*:*' check-for-changes true
    }

    add-zsh-hook precmd vcs_info

You can use `${vcs_info_msg_0_}` in your prompt to display the current
branch, the presence of staged and unstaged changes, as well as the
ongoing action.[^1] Have a look at the [documentation][] for more
details.

[^1]: Actions include "merge," "rebase" and "bisect."

presence of tracked and untracked
changes]([[!!images/zsh-vcs-prompt@2x.png]] "Example of prompt
including information from the <code>vcs_info</code> function.")

On large repositories, some information are expensive to fetch. While
`vcs_info` queries Git, interactions with Zsh are stuck. A possible
solution is to execute `vcs_info` asynchronously with [zsh-async][].

The first step is to **define a wrapper** around `vcs_info`. This
wrapper will run into a separate process and should communicate its
result using the standard output. It expects the current directory as
its first argument.

    ::sh
    _vbe_vcs_info() {
        cd -q $1
        vcs_info
        print ${vcs_info_msg_0_}
    }

The second step is to **define a worker**, `vcs_info`, and attach a
function to handle the result received from the wrapper. The
registered function calls `zle reset-prompt` to force a refresh of the
prompt with the updated information from `${vcs_info_msg_0_}`.

    ::sh
    source $ZSH/.../async.zsh
    async_init
    async_start_worker vcs_info
    async_register_callback vcs_info _vbe_vcs_info_done

    _vbe_vcs_info_done() {
        local stdout=$3
        vcs_info_msg_0_=$stdout
        zle reset-prompt
    }

The last step is to **schedule the wrapper function** in the worker
queue before displaying the prompt. This replaces the synchronous
invocation of `vcs_info`:

    ::sh
    _vbe_vcs_precmd() {
        async_flush_jobs vcs_info
        async_job vcs_info _vbe_vcs_info $PWD
    }
    add-zsh-hook precmd _vbe_vcs_precmd

That's it!

Without relying on `vcs_info`, it should be possible to have a better
experience by fetching the current branch name before retrieving the
more expensive information. However, without much effort, this simple
integration can make your prompt snappier! Have a look at the
[complete code][]: it contains some small enhancements.
