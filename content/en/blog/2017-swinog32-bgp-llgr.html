Here are the slides I presented during a lightning talk for [SwiNOG #32][]
at Berne, Switzerland, in 2017. It is a followup of the talk
given at [SwiNOG #31][] on how to make BGP sessions more resilient
while still reactive by using BGP LLGR. More details are available in
"[BGP LLGR: robust and reactive BGP sessions][]."
