!!! "TL;DR" When configuring a Linux bridge, use the following
commands to enforce isolation:

    ::console
    # bridge vlan del dev br0 vid 1 self
    # ip link set dev br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1

---

A network bridge (also commonly called a "switch") brings several
Ethernet segments together. It is a common element in most
infrastructures. Linux provides its own implementation.

A typical use of a Linux bridge is shown below. The **hypervisor** is
running three **virtual hosts**. Each virtual host is attached to the
`br0` **bridge** (represented by the horizontal segment). The hypervisor
has two physical network interfaces:

 - `eth0` is attached to a **public network** providing various services
   for the virtual hosts (DHCP, DNS, NTP, routers to Internet, ...). It is
   also part of the `br0` bridge.
 - `eth1` is attached to an **infrastructure network** providing
   various services to the hypervisor (DNS, NTP, configuration
   management, routers to Internet, ...). It is **not** part of the
   `br0` bridge.

![Typical use of Linux bridging with virtual machines][1]
[1]: [[!!images/isolated-bridge-v3.svg]] "Typical use of Linux bridging on a hypervisor with virtual hosts"

The main expectation of such a setup is that while the virtual hosts
should be able to use resources from the public network, they should
**not be able to access resources from the infrastructure network**
(including resources hosted on the hypervisor itself, like a SSH
server). In other words, we expect total isolation between the green
domain and the purple one.

That's not the case. From any virtual host:

    ::console
    # ip route add 192.168.14.3/32 dev eth0
    # ping -c 3 192.168.14.3
    PING 192.168.14.3 (192.168.14.3) 56(84) bytes of data.

# Why?

There are two main factors of this behavior:

 1. **A bridge can accept IP traffic**. This is a useful feature if
    you want Linux to act as a bridge and provide some IP services to
    bridge users (a DHCP relay or a default gateway). This is usually
    done by configuring the IP address on the bridge device: `ip addr
    add 192.0.2.2/25 dev br0`.
 2. **An interface doesn't need an IP address to process incoming IP
    traffic**. Additionally, by default, Linux accepts to answer ARP
    requests independently from the incoming interface.

## Bridge processing

After turning an incoming Ethernet frame into a socket buffer, the
network driver transfers the buffer to the `netif_receive_skb()`
function. The following actions are executed:

 1. evaluate the **XDP receive hooks**,
 2. copy the frame to any registered global or per-device **taps**
    (e.g. `tcpdump`),
 3. evaluate the **ingress policy** (configured with `tc`),
 4. hand over the frame to the device-specific **receive handler**, if
    any,
 5. hand over the frame to a global or device-specific **protocol
    handler** (e.g. IPv4, ARP, IPv6).

For a bridged interface, the kernel has configured a device-specific
receive handler, `br_handle_frame()`. This function won't allow any
additional processing in the context of the incoming interface, except
for STP and LLDP frames, or if "brouting" is
enabled.[^brouting] Therefore, the **protocol handlers are never
executed** in this case.

[^brouting]: A frame can be forcibly routed (L3) instead of bridged
    (L2) by "brouting" the packet. This action can be [triggered using
    `ebtables`][brouting].

After a few additional checks, Linux will decide if the frame has to
be locally delivered:

 - the entry for the target MAC in the FDB is marked for local delivery; or
 - the target MAC is a broadcast or a multicast address.

In this case, the frame is passed to the `br_pass_frame_up()`
function. A VLAN-related check is optionally performed. The socket
buffer is attached to the bridge interface (`br0`) instead of the
physical interface (`eth0`). It is evaluated by *Netfilter* and sent
back to `netif_receive_skb()`. It will go through the four steps a
second time.

## IPv4 processing

When a device doesn't have a protocol-independent receive handler, a
protocol-specific handler will be used:

    ::console
    # cat /proc/net/ptype
    Type Device      Function
    0800          ip_rcv
    0011          llc_rcv [llc]
    0004          llc_rcv [llc]
    0806          arp_rcv
    86dd          ipv6_rcv

Therefore, if the Ethernet type of the incoming frame is `0x800`, the
socket buffer is handled by `ip_rcv()`. Among other things, the three
following steps will happen:

 - If the frame destination address is not the MAC address of the
   incoming interface, not a multicast one, and not a broadcast one, the
   frame is dropped ("not for us").
 - *Netfilter* gets a chance to evaluate the packet (in a `PREROUTING`
   chain).
 - The routing subsystem will decide the destination of the packet
   in `ip_route_input_slow()`: is it a local packet, should it be
   forwarded, should it be dropped, should it be encapsulated?
   Notably, the reverse-path filtering is done during this evaluation
   in `fib_validate_source()`.

Reverse-path filtering (also known as uRPF, or unicast reverse-path
forwarding, [RFC 3704][]) enables Linux to reject traffic on
interfaces which it should never have originated: the source address
is looked up in the routing tables and if the outgoing interface is
different from the current incoming one, the packet is rejected.

## ARP processing

When the Ethernet type of the incoming frame is `0x806`, the socket
buffer is handled by `arp_rcv()`.

 - As with IPv4, if the frame is not for us, it is dropped.
 - If the incoming device has the `NOARP` flag, the frame is dropped.
 - *Netfilter* gets a chance to evaluate the packet (configuration is
   done with `arptables`).
 - For an ARP request, the values of `arp_ignore` and `arp_filter` may
   trigger a drop of the packet.

## IPv6 processing

When the Ethernet type of the incoming frame is `0x86dd`, the socket
buffer is handled by `ipv6_rcv()`.

 - As with IPv4, if the frame is not for us, it is dropped.
 - If IPv6 is disabled on the interface, the packet is dropped.
 - *Netfilter* gets a chance to evaluate the packet (in a `PREROUTING`
   chain).
 - The routing subsystem will decide the destination of the
   packet. However, unlike IPv4, there is no reverse-path
   filtering.[^rpfilter]

[^rpfilter]: For IPv6, reverse-path filtering needs to be implemented
    with *Netfilter*, using the [`rpfilter` match][rpfilter match].

# Workarounds

There are various methods to fix the situation.

We can completely ignore the bridged interfaces: as long as they are
attached to the bridge, they cannot process any upper layer protocol
(IPv4, IPv6, ARP). Therefore, we can focus on filtering incoming
traffic from `br0`.

It should be noted that for IPv4, IPv6, and ARP protocols, the MAC
address check can be circumvented by using the broadcast MAC address.

## Protocol-independent workarounds

The four following fixes will indistinctly drop IPv4, ARP, and IPv6
packets.

### Using VLAN-aware bridge

Linux 3.9 introduced the ability to use VLAN filtering on bridge
ports. This can be used to prevent any local traffic:[^older]

    ::console
    # ip link set dev br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1
    # bridge vlan del dev br0 vid 1 self
    # bridge vlan show
    port    vlan ids
    eth0     1 PVID Egress Untagged
    eth2     1 PVID Egress Untagged
    eth3     1 PVID Egress Untagged
    eth4     1 PVID Egress Untagged
    br0     None

[^older]: With a kernel older than Linux 4.3, you'll have to use the
    following command instead of `ip link`:

        ::console
        # echo 1 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/vlan_filtering

This is the most efficient method since the frame is dropped directly
in `br_pass_frame_up()`.

### Using XDP receive hooks

It's also possible to drop the bridged frame early after it has been
re-delivered to `netif_receive_skb()` by `br_pass_frame_up()`. The XDP
hooks attached to an interface are evaluated before taps, ingress
policy, and handlers. A very simple `xdp_drop_all.c` program would
look like this:

    ::c
    #include <linux/bpf.h>

    int main()
    {
        return XDP_DROP;
    }

It can be compiled and installed with:

    ::console
    $ clang -O2 -target bpf -c xdp_drop_all.c -o xdp_drop_all.o
    $ sudo ip link set dev br0 xdp obj xdp_drop_all.o sec .text

This requires [Linux 4.14][] and this is the second most efficient
method but a bit inconvenient as it needs a compiler.[^ebpf]

[^ebpf]: The above program is so simple it could be written without a
    compiler:

        ::console
        $ ip -d l l dev br0 | tail -1
            prog/xdp id 1 tag 57cd311f2e27366b
        $ bpftool prog dump xlated id 1
           0: (b7) r0 = 1
           1: (95) exit
        $ readelf -x .text xdp_drop_all_kern.o
        b7000000 01000000 95000000 00000000

    However, `ip link` requires an ELF object.

### Using ingress policy

The ingress policy of an interface is evaluated just a bit later but
before any handler. Therefore, the following commands will ensure no
local delivery happens:

    ::console
    # tc qdisc add dev br0 handle ffff: ingress
    # tc filter add dev br0 parent ffff: matchall action drop

This is the third most efficient method but is more convenient than
the previous one for a very tiny additional overhead.

!!! "Update (2020-01)" Since [Linux 4.2][], it is possible to use
*Netfilter* to setup the ingress policy with the same efficiency. This
can be done through [nftables][]:

    ::console
    # nft -f - <<EOF
    > table netdev firewall {
    >   chain ingress {
    >     type filter hook ingress device br0 priority 0; policy drop;
    >     log
    >   }
    > }
    > EOF

### Using `ebtables`

Just before re-delivering the frame to `netif_receive_skb()`,
*Netfilter* gets a chance to issue a decision. It's easy to configure it
to drop the frame:

    ::console
    # ebtables -A INPUT --logical-in br0 -j DROP

However, to the best of my knowledge, this part of *Netfilter* is
known to be inefficient.

### Using namespaces

Isolation can also be obtained by moving all the bridged interfaces
into a dedicated network namespace and configure the bridge inside this
namespace:

    ::console
    # ip netns add bridge0
    # ip link set netns bridge0 eth0
    # ip link set netns bridge0 eth2
    # ip link set netns bridge0 eth3
    # ip link set netns bridge0 eth4
    # ip link del dev br0
    # ip netns exec bridge0 brctl addbr br0
    # for i in 0 2 3 4; do
    >    ip netns exec bridge0 brctl addif br0 eth$i
    >    ip netns exec bridge0 ip link set up dev eth$i
    > done
    # ip netns exec bridge0 ip link set up dev br0

The frame will still wander a bit inside the IP stack, wasting some
CPU cycles and increasing the possible attack surface. But ultimately,
it will be dropped.

## Protocol-dependent workarounds

Unless you require multiple layers of security, if one of the previous
workarounds is already applied, there is no need to apply one of the
protocol-dependent fix below. It's still interesting to know them
because it is not uncommon to already have them in place.

### ARP

The easiest way to disable ARP processing on a bridge is to set the
`NOARP` flag on the device. The ARP packet will be dropped as the very
first step of the ARP handler.

    ::console
    # ip link set arp off dev br0
    # ip l l dev br0
    8: br0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 50:54:33:00:00:04 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

`arptables` can also drop the packet quite early:

    ::console
    # arptables -A INPUT -i br0 -j DROP

Another way is to set `arp_ignore` to 2 for the given interface. The
kernel will only answer to ARP requests whose target IP address is
configured on the incoming interface. Since the bridge interface
doesn't have an IP address, no ARP requests will be answered.

    ::console
    # sysctl -qw net.ipv4.conf.br0.arp_ignore=2

Disabling ARP processing is not a sufficient workaround for IPv4. A
user can still insert the appropriate entry in its neighbor cache:

    ::console
    # ip neigh replace 192.168.14.3 lladdr 50:54:33:00:00:04 dev eth0
    # ping -c 1 192.168.14.3
    PING 192.168.14.3 (192.168.14.3) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.14.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=49 time=1.30 ms

    --- 192.168.14.3 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.309/1.309/1.309/0.000 ms

Because the check on the target MAC address is quite loose, they don't
even need to guess the MAC address:

    ::console
    # ip neigh replace 192.168.14.3 lladdr ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff dev eth0
    # ping -c 1 192.168.14.3
    PING 192.168.14.3 (192.168.14.3) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.14.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=49 time=1.12 ms

    --- 192.168.14.3 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.129/1.129/1.129/0.000 ms

### IPv4

The earliest place to drop an IPv4 packet is with
*Netfilter*:[^filtering]

    ::console
    # iptables -t raw -I PREROUTING -i br0 -j DROP

[^filtering]: If the `br_netfilter` module is loaded,
    `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ipatbles` *sysctl* has to be set
    to 0. Otherwise, you also need to use
    the [`physdev` match][physdev match] to not drop IPv4 packets
    going *through* the bridge.

If *Netfilter* is disabled, another possibility is to enable strict
reverse-path filtering for the interface. In this case, since there is
no IP address configured on the interface, the packet will be dropped
during the route lookup:

    ::console
    # sysctl -qw net.ipv4.conf.br0.rp_filter=1

Another option is the use of a dedicated routing rule. Compared to the
reverse-path filtering option, the packet will be dropped a bit
earlier, still during the route lookup.

    ::console
    # ip rule add iif br0 blackhole

### IPv6

Linux provides a way to completely disable IPv6 on a given
interface. The packet will be dropped as the very first step of the
IPv6 handler:

    ::console
    # sysctl -qw net.ipv6.conf.br0.disable_ipv6=1

As with IPv4, it's possible to use *Netfilter* or a dedicated routing
rule.

# About the example

In the above example, the virtual host gets ICMP replies because they
are routed through the infrastructure network to Internet (e.g. the
hypervisor has a default gateway which also acts as a NAT router to
Internet). This may not be the case.

If you want to check if you are "vulnerable" despite not getting an
ICMP reply, look at the guest neighbor table to check if you got an
ARP reply from the host:

    ::console
    # ip route add 192.168.14.3/32 dev eth0
    # ip neigh show dev eth0
    192.168.14.3 lladdr 50:54:33:00:00:04 REACHABLE

If you didn't get a reply, you could still have issues with IP
processing. Add a static neighbor entry before checking the next step:

    ::console
    # ip neigh replace 192.168.14.3 lladdr ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff dev eth0

To check if IP processing is enabled, check the bridge host's network
statistics:

    ::console
    # netstat -s | grep "ICMP messages"
        15 ICMP messages received
        15 ICMP messages sent
        0 ICMP messages failed

If the counters are increasing, it is processing incoming IP packets.

One-way communication still allows a lot of bad things, like DoS
attacks. Additionally, if the hypervisor happens to also act as a
router, the reach is extended to the whole infrastructure network,
potentially exposing weak devices (e.g. PDU) exposing an SNMP
agent. If one-way communication is all that's needed, the attacker can
also spoof its source IP address, bypassing IP-based authentication.

# About MACVLAN interfaces

When source-address learning is not needed, bridges can be replaced by
MACVLAN or MACVTAP interfaces. Have a look at the following
article for more details: "[Bridge vs Macvlan][MACVLAN]."

In this case, the packet processing is different and asymmetric. When
a frame exits the MACVLAN interface, it is directly transmitted to
the appropriate interface (either another MACVLAN interface or the
lower device). In this direction, communication with the host is not
possible.

However, when a frame enters the lower device, if the destination MAC
is not one of the sub-interfaces, the frame is processed by the host
using the appropriate *protocol handler* (ARP, IPv4, IPv6). Therefore,
isolation can only be obtained by
using
[the protocol-dependent methods](#protocol-dependent-workarounds).
