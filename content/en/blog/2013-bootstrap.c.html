When starting a new HTML project, a common base is [HTML5
Boilerplate][] which helps by setting up the essential bits. Such a
template is quite useful for both beginners and experienced developers
as it is kept up-to-date with best practices and it avoids forgetting
some of them.

Recently, I have started several little projects written in C for a
customer. Each project was bootstrapped from the previous one. I
thought it would be useful to start a template that I could reuse
easily. Hence, [bootstrap.c][],[^name] a template for simple projects written
in C with the _autotools_, was born.

[^name]: Retrospectively, I think `boilerplate.c` would have been a
         better name.

# Usage

A new project can be created from this template in three steps:

 1. Run [Cookiecutter][], a command-line tool to create projects from
    project templates, and answer the questions.
 2. Setup _Git_.
 3. Complete the "todo list."

## Cookiecutter

[Cookiecutter][] is a new tool to create projects from project
templates. It uses [Jinja2][] as a template engine for file names and
contents. It is language agnostic: you can use it for Python, HTML,
Javascript or... C!

_Cookiecutter_ is quite simple. You can read an [introduction from
Daniel Greenfeld][]. Bootstrapping a new project is super easy:

    ::console
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/vincentbernat/bootstrap.c.git
    Cloning into 'bootstrap.c'...
    remote: Counting objects: 90, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (68/68), done.
    remote: Total 90 (delta 48), reused 64 (delta 22)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (90/90), done.
    Checking connectivity... done
    
    full_name (default is "Vincent Bernat")? Alfred Thirsty
    email (default is "bernat@luffy.cx")? alfred@thirsty.eu
    repo_name (default is "bootstrap")? secretproject
    project_name (default is "bootstrap")? secretproject
    project_description (default is "boilerplate for small C programs with autotools")? Super secret project for humans

_Cookiecutter_ asks a few questions to instantiate the template
correctly. The result has been stored in the `supersecret`
directory:

    .
    ├── autogen.sh
    ├── configure.ac
    ├── get-version
    ├── m4
    │   ├── ax_cflags_gcc_option.m4
    │   └── ax_ld_check_flag.m4
    ├── Makefile.am
    ├── README.md
    └── src
        ├── log.c
        ├── log.h
        ├── Makefile.am
        ├── secretproject.8
        ├── secretproject.c
        └── secretproject.h
    
    2 directories, 13 files

## Remaining steps

There are still a few steps to be executed manually. You first need to
initialize _Git_, as some features of this template rely on it:

    ::console
    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/bernat/tmp/secretproject/.git/
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Initial import"
    […]

Then, you need to extract the todo list built from the comments
contained in source files:

    ::console
    $ git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD | \
    >   xargs grep -nH "T[O]DO:" | \
    >   sed 's/\([^:]*:[^:]*\):\(.*\)T[O]DO:\(.*\)/\3 (\1)/' | \
    >   sort -ns | \
    >   awk '(last != $1) {print ""} {last=$1 ; print}'
    
    2003 Add the dependencies of your project here. (configure.ac:52)
    2003 The use of "Jansson" here is an example, you don't have (configure.ac:53)
    2003 to keep it. (configure.ac:54)
    
    2004 Each time you have used `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` macro (src/Makefile.am:12)
    2004 in `configure.ac`, you get two variables that (src/Makefile.am:13)
    2004 you can substitute like above. (src/Makefile.am:14)
    
    3000 It's time for you program to do something. Add anything (src/secretproject.c:76)
    3000 you want here. */ (src/secretproject.c:77)
    […]

Only a few minutes are needed to complete these steps.

# What do you get?

Here are the main features:

 - Minimal `configure.ac` and `Makefile.am`.
 - Changelog based on _Git_ logs and automatic version from _Git_ tags.[^ref]
 - Manual page skeleton.
 - Logging infrastructure with variadic functions like `log_warn()`,
   `log_info()`.

        presentation in a [previous post about _lldpd_][].

# About the use of the autotools

The _autotools_ are a suite of tools to provide a build system for a
project, including:

 - `autoconf` to generate a configure script, and
 - `automake` to generate _makefiles_ using a similar but higher-level
   language.

Understanding the _autotools_ can be a quite difficult task. There are
a lot of bad documentations on the web and the manual does not help by
describing corner-cases that would be useful if you wanted your
project to compile for HP-UX. So, why do I use it?

 1. I have invested a lot of time in the understanding of this build
    system. Once you grasp how it should be used, it works reasonably
    well and can cover most of your needs. Maybe [CMake][] would be a
    better choice but I have yet to learn it. Moreover, the
    _autotools_ are so widespread that you have to know how they work.
 2. There are a lot of macros available for `autoconf`. Many of them
    are included in the [GNU Autoconf Archive][] and ready to use. The
    quality of such macros are usually quite good. If you need to
    correctly detect the appropriate way to compile a program with
    _GNU Readline_ or something compatible, there is a macro for that.

If you want to learn more about the _autotools_, do **not** read the
manual. Instead, have a look at [Autotools Mythbuster][]. Start with a
minimal `configure.ac` and do not add useless macros: a macro should
be used only if it solves a real problem.

Happy hacking!
