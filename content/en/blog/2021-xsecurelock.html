title: "Custom screen saver with XSecureLock"

  XSecureLock is an X11 screen lock utility, which delegates the screen saver to a
  third-party program, paving the way to safe customizations.

[i3lock][] is a popular X11 screen lock utility. As far as
customization goes, it only allows one to set a background from a PNG
file. This limitation is part of the design of *i3lock*: its primary
goal is to keep the screen locked, something difficult enough with
X11. Each additional feature would increase the attack surface and
move away from this goal.[^source1] Many are frustrated with these
limitations and extend *i3lock* through simple wrapper scripts or by
forking it.[^source2] The first solution is usually safe, but the
second goes against the spirit of *i3lock*.

[^source1]: See for example [this comment][comment1] or [this
    one][comment2] explaining the rationale.
[^source2]: This [Reddit post][] enumerates many of these alternatives.

[XSecureLock][] is a less-known alternative to *i3lock*. One of the
most attractive features of this locker is to delegate the screen
saver feature to another process. This process can be anything as long
it can attach to an existing window provided by *XSecureLock*, which
won't pass any input to it. It will also put a black window below it
to ensure the screen stays locked in case of a crash.

*XSecureLock* is shipped with a few screen savers, notably one using
[mpv][] to display photos or videos, like the [Apple TV aerial
videos][]. I have written my [own saver][] using Python and GTK.[^gtk]
It shows a background image, a clock, and the current
weather.[^weather]

![Custom screen saver for XSecureLock, displaying a clock and the
current weather]([[!!images/i3/xsecurelock@2x.jpg]] "Custom screen
saver for XSecureLock")

[^gtk]: Using GTK makes it a bit difficult to use some low-level
    features, like embedding an application into an existing window.
    However, the high-level features are easier, notably drawing an
    image and a text with a shadow.

[^weather]: Weather is retrieved by [another script][] running on a
    timer and written to a file. The screen saver watches this file
    for updates.

I add two patches over *XSecureLock*:

- [Sleep before mapping screen saver window][]. This patch prevents a
  flash of black when starting *XSecureLock* by waiting a bit for the
  screen saver to be ready before displaying it. As I am also using a
  [custom dimmer][] fading to the expected background before locking,
  the flash of black was quite annoying for me. I have good hope this
  patch will be accepted upstream.
- [Do not mess with DPMS/blanking][]. This patch prevents
  *XSecureLock* from blanking the screen. I think this is solely the
  role of the X11 DPMS extension. This makes the code simpler. I am
  unsure if this patch would be accepted by upstream.

*XSecureLock* also delegates the authentication window to another
process, but I was less comfortable providing a custom one as it is a
bit more security-sensitive. While basic, the shipped authentication
application is fine by me.

I think people should avoid modifying *i3lock* code and use
*XSecureLock* instead. I hope this post will help a bit.

!!! "Update (2022-01)" [XScreenSaver][] can also run [arbitrary
programs as a screen saver][].
