title: "HiDPI on dual 4K monitors with Linux"
description: |
  I have bought a pair of HiDPI Dell P2415Q monitors for my
  workstation. Support in Linux with X11 is still not satisfactory.

I have been using a [Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon][] laptop (210 DPI) for
four years and a [Nokia 8][] phone (550 DPI) for a year. I enjoy their
HiDPI screens: the text is crisp and easy to read. To get a similar
experience for my workstation, I bought a pair of [Dell P2415Q][]
monitors:

![Two Dell P2415Q]([[!!images/dual-dell-p2415q@2x.jpg]] "Dual screen setup with two Dell P2415Q monitors")

# Monitors

The *Dell P2415Q* is a 24" display featuring an IPS panel with a
3840×2160 resolution (185 DPI) and complete coverage of the sRGB
color space. It was released in 2015 and its price is now below US$400.
It received [positive reviews][].

One of my units arrived with a dead pixel. I thought it was a problem
from the past but [Dell policy on dead pixels][] says:

> During LCD manufacturing process, it is not uncommon for one or more
> sub-pixels to become fixed in an unchanging state. A display with a
> 1 to 5 fixed sub-pixel is considered normal and within industry
> standards.

!!! "Update (2018-12)" Three new dead pixels have appeared. Therefore,
I do not recommend these screens.

Another issue is the presence of faint horizontal gray lines, (barely)
visible on white background. The issue seems to [not be uncommon][]
but Dell is dismissive about it. If I sit correctly, the lines become
invisible.

!!! "Update (2020-06)" This happens when the screen is connected
through HDMI. In this case, the pixel format may be YCbCr of RGB. I
have fixed the problem by [hacking the EDID of the display][] so the
driver chooses RGB.

I am a bit disappointed by these issues, but I think they are bearable
and it is an opportunity to help fix my obsession over such details.

# Graphics card

To drive a 4K display at 60 Hz, you need at least either [HDMI 2.0][]
or [DisplayPort 1.2][]. The *Dell P2415Q* has been [upgraded to HDMI
2.0][] in 2016 and also provides a DP 1.2 input. There is a port for
daisy-chaining a second monitor but, without support for DP 1.3, the
refresh rate would drop to 30 Hz.

There is currently no available Radeon card around US$100 able to drive
two 4K displays. On the NVIDIA side, the [GeForce GT 1030][] fits the
bill with a power consumption of 20 W for the DDR4 version. I opted
for a [passively cooled model from MSI][]. On Linux, the result is
quite disappointing:

 - The [nouveau driver][] has still [rudimentary support][] for this
   generation of NVIDIA chips. The result was unbearably slow and the
   HDMI 2.0 port was not handled correctly.

 - The [proprietary NVIDIA driver][] exhibits poor performance. It's
   difficult to know if this is due to the graphic card itself,[^perf]
   or to the drivers. I've tested 390, 396, 410, 415, and 418.
   Moreover, suspend-to-RAM is broken.

[^perf]: Compared to my previous setup, the number of pixels is
    quadrupled. The card is using 4-lane links over PCI 3.0 which
    translates to a bandwidth of 25 Gbits/s. This barely allows the
    transfer of 7680×2160 pixels at 60 Hz using 24-bit colors. Also,
    the use of DDR4 for such a graphic card is seen as a [cheap
    move][].

!!! "Update (2019-05)" I have switched to an [ASUS Phoenix Radeon RX
550][]. With such a card, everything runs smoothly, using the
open-source driver `amdgpu`. The card comes with a fan but it is
PWM-controlled. See [ArchWiki][amdgpu-fan] for more details. In
automatic mode, when
`/sys/class/drm/card0/device/hwmon/hwmon1/pwm1_enable` is set to `2`,
it spins at 1050 RPM:

    ::console
    $ sensors amdgpu-pci-0100
    amdgpu-pci-0100
    Adapter: PCI adapter
    vddgfx:       +0.88 V
    fan1:        1047 RPM
    temp1:        +51.0°C  (crit = +94.0°C, hyst = -273.1°C)
    power1:       17.20 W  (cap =  35.00 W)

# HiDPI support on Linux with X11

GNOME and KDE now support HiDPI displays out of the box when running
with X11. For other environments, it's quite easy to setup, thanks to
[xsettingsd][]. The following snippet should be invoked from
`~/.xsession` or when the DPI value changes:

    ::shell
    # Target DPI
    dpi=192

    # For applications supporting XSettings, `Xft/DPI' sets font scaling
    # (and sometimes interface scaling), `Gdk/WindowScalingFactor' sets
    # interface scaling with GTK 3, and `Gdk/UnscaledDPI' undo font scaling
    # for GTK 3 applications.
    > ~/.xsettingsd cat <<EOF
    Xft/DPI $(( $dpi*1024 ))
    Gdk/WindowScalingFactor $(( $dpi/96 ))
    Gdk/UnscaledDPI $(( $dpi*1024/($dpi/96) ))
    EOF
    pkill -HUP xsettingsd || xsettingsd &

    # For QT applications.
    export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1

    # For miscellaneous applications.
    echo Xft.dpi: $dpi | xrdb -merge

Then, it is up to each application to know how to render on a HiDPI
display. The table below gives an overview of HiDPI support for
various ones, using the above settings. "*Text scaling*" indicates if
an application can adapt the font size. This is usually the
most essential feature. "*Interface scaling*" tells if it can
scale the whole interface, including the icons. Ideally, applications
are also expected to be able to dynamically update scaling when
notified through *XSettings*, which is useful when switching to an
external display.

[^chromium]: To detect changes, *Chromium* watches for *RandR* events.
    They may be caught before *XSettings* variables are updated.

[^electron]: If it doesn't work, try with the
    `--force-device-scale-factor=2` flag.

[^blender]: *Blender* relies on [the `Xft.dpi` resource value][blender].

[^java]: Java applications need to be invoked with the `GDK_SCALE=2`
    environment variable. Otherwise, they don't scale.

**QT 5** applications offer very good support. **GTK 3** applications
can currently only scale their interfaces using an integer factor,
which is annoying when you need a 1.5× factor. **GTK 2** applications
will only scale the text and there are still many of them—notably
*Gimp*. For more details, have a look at the dedicated page on
[ArchWiki][]. Beyond X11, [Wayland][] can provide per-monitor
scaling[^mixed-dpi] and to scale applications without HiDPI support.

[^mixed-dpi]: QT also supports mixed DPI with
    `QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1`. GTK does not, but screens with
    lower DPI can be rendered up with a higher resolution and scaled
    down with the `--scale` option of `xrandr`. See "[Mixed DPI and
    the X Window System][]" for more details and "[Configuring mixed
    DPI monitors with xrandr][]" for a focus on how to use `xrandr`.

In conclusion, today's situation still depends heavily on the
applications you run. As I spend most of my time in a [VTE terminal][],
Emacs and, Firefox, I am mostly happy with the result.
