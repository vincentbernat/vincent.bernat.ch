My [home router][] acts as an access point with an
[Intel Dual-Band Wireless-AC 7260 wireless card][].  This card
supports [802.11ac][] (on the 5 GHz band) and [802.11n][] (on both the
5 GHz and 2.4 GHz band). While this seems a very decent card to use in
managed mode, this is not really a great choice for an access point.

    ::console
    $ lspci -k -nn -d 8086:08b1
    03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Wireless 7260 [8086:08b1] (rev 73)
            Subsystem: Intel Corporation Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 [8086:4070]
            Kernel driver in use: iwlwifi

!!! "TL;DR" Use an Atheros card instead.

# Limitations

First, the card is said "dual-band" but you can only uses **one band**
at a time because there is only **one radio**. Almost all wireless
cards have this limitation. If you want to use both the 2.4 GHz band
and the less crowded 5 GHz band, two cards are usually needed.

## 5 GHz band

There is **no support to set an access point on the 5 GHz band**. The
firmware doesn't allow it. This can be checked with `iw`:

    ::console
    $ iw reg get
    country CH: DFS-ETSI
      (2402 - 2482 @ 40), (N/A, 20), (N/A)
      (5170 - 5250 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (N/A)
      (5250 - 5330 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (0 ms), DFS
      (5490 - 5710 @ 80), (N/A, 27), (0 ms), DFS
      (57240 - 65880 @ 2160), (N/A, 40), (N/A), NO-OUTDOOR
    $ iw list

    […]

While the 5 GHz band is allowed by the [CRDA][], all frequencies are
marked with `no IR`. Here is the [explanation for this flag][no-ir]:

> The `no-ir` flag exists to allow regulatory domain definitions to
> disallow a device from initiating radiation of any kind and that
> includes using beacons, so for example AP/IBSS/Mesh/GO interfaces
> would not be able to initiate communication on these channels unless
> the channel does not have this flag.

## Multiple SSID

This card can **only advertise one SSID**. Managing several of them is
useful to setup distinct wireless networks, like a public access
(routed to [Tor][]), a guest access and a private access. `iw` can
confirm this:

    ::console
    $ iw list
    […]
    valid interface combinations:
       * #{ managed } <= 1, #{ AP, P2P-client, P2P-GO } <= 1, #{ P2P-device } <= 1,
         total <= 3, #channels <= 1

Here is the output of an Atheros card able to manage 8 SSID:

    ::console
    $ iw list
    […]
    valid interface combinations:
       * #{ managed, WDS, P2P-client } <= 2048, #{ IBSS, AP, mesh point, P2P-GO } <= 8,
         total <= 2048, #channels <= 1

# Configuration as an access point

Except for these two limitations, the card works fine as an access
point. Here is the configuration that I use for `hostapd`:

    ::ini
    interface=wlan-guest
    driver=nl80211
    
    # Radio
    ssid=XXXXXXXXX
    hw_mode=g
    channel=11
    
    # 802.11n
    wmm_enabled=1
    ieee80211n=1
    ht_capab=[HT40-][SHORT-GI-20][SHORT-GI-40][DSSS_CCK-40][DSSS_CCK-40][DSSS_CCK-40]
    
    # WPA
    auth_algs=1
    wpa=2
    wpa_passphrase=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    wpa_pairwise=TKIP
    rsn_pairwise=CCMP

Because of the use of channel 11, only *802.11n* *HT40-* rate can be
enabled. Look at the [Wikipedia page for 802.11n][] to check if you
can use either *HT40-*, *HT40+* or both.
