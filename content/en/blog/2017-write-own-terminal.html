I was a happy user of [rxvt-unicode][] until I got a laptop with an
HiDPI display. Switching from a LoDPI to a HiDPI screen and back was a
pain: I had to manually adjust the font size on all terminals or
restart them.

[VTE][] is a **library to build a terminal emulator** using the GTK+
toolkit, which handles DPI changes. It is used by many terminal
emulators,
like [GNOME Terminal][], [evilvte][], [sakura][], [termit][]
and [ROXTerm][]. The library is quite straightforward and writing a
terminal doesn't take much time if you don't need many features.

Let's see how to write a simple one.

# A simple terminal

Let's start small with a terminal with the default settings. We'll write
that in C. Another supported option is [Vala][].

    ::c
    #include <vte/vte.h>
    
    int
    main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        GtkWidget *window, *terminal;
    
        /* Initialise GTK, the window and the terminal */
        gtk_init(&argc, &argv);
        terminal = vte_terminal_new();
        window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
        gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), "myterm");
    
        /* Start a new shell */
        gchar **envp = g_get_environ();
        gchar **command = (gchar *[]){g_strdup(g_environ_getenv(envp, "SHELL")), NULL };
        g_strfreev(envp);
        vte_terminal_spawn_async(VTE_TERMINAL(terminal),
            VTE_PTY_DEFAULT,
            NULL,       /* working directory  */
            command,    /* command */
            NULL,       /* environment */
            0,          /* spawn flags */
            NULL, NULL, /* child setup */
            NULL,       /* child pid */
            -1,         /* timeout */
            NULL, NULL, NULL);
    
        /* Connect some signals */
        g_signal_connect(window, "delete-event", gtk_main_quit, NULL);
        g_signal_connect(terminal, "child-exited", gtk_main_quit, NULL);
    
        /* Put widgets together and run the main loop */
        gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), terminal);
        gtk_widget_show_all(window);
        gtk_main();
    }

You can compile it with the following command:

    ::shell
    gcc -O2 -Wall $(pkg-config --cflags vte-2.91) term.c -o term $(pkg-config --libs vte-2.91)

And run it with `./term`:

# More features

From here, you can have a look at the [documentation][] to alter
behavior or add more features. Here are three examples.

## Colors

You can define the 16 basic colors with the following code:

    ::c
    #define CLR_R(x)   (((x) & 0xff0000) >> 16)
    #define CLR_G(x)   (((x) & 0x00ff00) >>  8)
    #define CLR_B(x)   (((x) & 0x0000ff) >>  0)
    #define CLR_16(x)  ((double)(x) / 0xff)
    #define CLR_GDK(x) (const GdkRGBA){ .red = CLR_16(CLR_R(x)), \
                                        .green = CLR_16(CLR_G(x)), \
                                        .blue = CLR_16(CLR_B(x)), \
                                        .alpha = 0 }
    vte_terminal_set_colors(VTE_TERMINAL(terminal),
        &CLR_GDK(0xffffff),
        &(GdkRGBA){ .alpha = 0.85 },
        (const GdkRGBA[]){
            CLR_GDK(0x111111),
            CLR_GDK(0xd36265),
            CLR_GDK(0xaece91),
            CLR_GDK(0xe7e18c),
            CLR_GDK(0x5297cf),
            CLR_GDK(0x963c59),
            CLR_GDK(0x5E7175),
            CLR_GDK(0xbebebe),
            CLR_GDK(0x666666),
            CLR_GDK(0xef8171),
            CLR_GDK(0xcfefb3),
            CLR_GDK(0xfff796),
            CLR_GDK(0x74b8ef),
            CLR_GDK(0xb85e7b),
            CLR_GDK(0xA3BABF),
            CLR_GDK(0xffffff)
    }, 16);
        
While you can't see it on the screenshot,[^compositing] this also
enables background transparency.

[^compositing]: Transparency is handled by the *composite manager*
    ([Compton][], in my case).

## Miscellaneous settings

*VTE* comes with many settings to change the behavior of the
terminal. Consider the following code:

    ::c
    vte_terminal_set_scrollback_lines(VTE_TERMINAL(terminal), 0);
    vte_terminal_set_scroll_on_output(VTE_TERMINAL(terminal), FALSE);
    vte_terminal_set_scroll_on_keystroke(VTE_TERMINAL(terminal), TRUE);
    vte_terminal_set_mouse_autohide(VTE_TERMINAL(terminal), TRUE);

This will:

 - disable the scrollback buffer,
 - not scroll to the bottom on new output,
 - scroll to the bottom on keystroke,
 - hide the mouse cursor when typing.
 
## Update the window title

An application can change the window title
using [XTerm control sequences][] (for example, with `printf
"\e]2;${title}\a"`). If you want the actual window title to reflect
this, you need to define this function:

    ::c
    static gboolean
    on_title_changed(GtkWidget *terminal, gpointer user_data)
    {
        GtkWindow *window = user_data;
        gtk_window_set_title(window,
            vte_terminal_get_window_title(VTE_TERMINAL(terminal))?:"Terminal");
        return TRUE;
    }

Then, connect it to the appropriate signal, in `main()`:

    ::c
    g_signal_connect(terminal, "window-title-changed", 
        G_CALLBACK(on_title_changed), GTK_WINDOW(window));

# Final words

I don't need much more as I am using [tmux][] inside each terminal. In
my [own copy][], I have also added the ability to complete a word
using ones from the current window or other windows (also known
as [dynamic abbrev expansion][]). This requires to implement a
**terminal daemon** to handle all terminal windows with one process,
similar to `urxvtcd`.

While writing a terminal "from scratch"[^scratch] suits my need, it may not be
worth it. <del>[evilvte][] is quite customizable and can be
lightweight. Consider it as a first alternative. Honestly, I don't
remember why I didn't pick it.</del>

!!! "Update (2017.02)" [evilvte][] has not seen an update
since 2014. Its GTK+3 support is buggy. It doesn't support the latest
versions of the VTE library. Therefore, it's not a good idea to use
it.

You should also note that the primary goal of *VTE* is to be a library
to support *GNOME Terminal*. Notably, if a feature is not needed for
*GNOME Terminal*, it won't be added to *VTE*. If it already exists, it
will likely to be deprecated and removed.

[^scratch]: For some definition of "scratch" since the hard work is
    handled by *VTE*.
