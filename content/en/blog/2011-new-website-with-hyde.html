My previous website was generated (dynamically) with `mod_autoindex`,
a module from Apache targeted at rendering an index page for the files
contained in a directory. Pretty basic (but themable). Here is a new
revamped web site using [Hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde), a static
web generator written in Python.

# Static or dynamic?

It has been a long time since almost everybody is creating dynamic
websites. Most often, they are powered by some blog engine written in PHP like
[DotClear](http://www.dotclear.org) or
[WordPress](http://www.wordpress.com/). Infrequently, they are crafted
with bare hands using one's preferred language. Nowadays, hosting a dynamic
website is pretty easy. There are a lot of cheap virtual servers
solution that allow you to get a root access.

However, dynamic websites have some drawbacks:

 * Security need to be monitored tightly, especially security
   upgrades; some platforms are more often vulnerable than others.
 * Dynamic websites may have some problem to handle increased load.

With a static website, security problems are easier: there are far
less components to monitor and most of them (for example, the web
server) are pretty solid and well audited.

A site powered by [nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/) can handle several
thousands of new connections per second without any special
tuning. Getting this kind of performance with a dynamic website is far
more difficult. Scaling is also easier. Just add more webservers and
copy the content. No database, no synchronisation mechanism needed.

Hosting can even be done on simple platforms like
[Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), even if there is now more
appropriate platforms for this like
[Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).

Moreover, even a static website can receive comments using a system like
[Disqus](http://disqus.com/) which leverages the use of Javascript to
add comment system to any static page.

# Hyde

[Hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde) is a static website generator
written in Python. There exists a lot of those beasts. On
[StackOverflow][2], a [question about this][1] got some interesting
answers. You will also find a fairly complete list on
[this blog][3]. If you like Ruby, I assume that [nanoc][4] and
[Webgen][5] are good candidates.

Let's go back to Hyde. It was rewritten recently and the documentation
is a bit incomplete. You will need to read the source code or look at
examples (like the shipped one or this site) to understand how things are
handled. Everything is handled by a plugin system. I hope it will not
become a mess in one year (I [play a large part in this][6]).

Hyde takes your files, apply a lot of filters on them and generate the
final website. It uses [Jinja][7]
as a template system, [Markdown][10] for markup syntax, [Less][8] to
write CSS in a more efficient way (and to minify them), [UglifyJS][9]
to minify Javascript, etc. It is also possible to add metadata to
files (title, author, creation date, etc.). But since everything comes
as a plugin, you can use any technology you like.

In the end, you can tune all knobs but you need to do most of the work
(HTML, CSS, Javascript), as well.

Conveniently, there is a small web server that rebuild modified files
on the fly. This comes handy but this is a common feature with this
kind of generator.

# New website

Here is a new website crafted with Hyde. It is translated both in
French and in English. This is done with the help of a small plugin
[plugin](https://github.com/vincentbernat/hyde/tree/multi-language-plugin).
I am quite happy about the result.

Technically, there is one minified CSS file, one minified Javascript
file and the dependencies (like [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)) are
loaded with the help of [yepnope.js](http://yepnopejs.com/) which will
become part of [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/).

I don't want to support Internet Explorer 6, but I plan to support
Firefox 3, Internet Explorer 7 and recent versions of Chrome and
Safari.

For the design, I have always been undecided. I am pretty impressed by
[some][11] [raw][12] [website][13] but also by some others more
[elaborate][14]. Since I am not a talented graphic designer, I have
tried to keep things plain and simple.
