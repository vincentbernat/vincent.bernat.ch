**VXLAN** is an **overlay network** to encapsulate Ethernet traffic
over an existing (highly available and scalable, possibly the
Internet) IP network while accomodating a very large number of
tenants. It is defined in [RFC 7348][]. For an uncut introduction on
its use with Linux, have a look at my "[VXLAN & Linux][]" post.

![VXLAN deployment][i1]
[i1]: [[!!images/vxlan/vxlan-deployment-v2.svg]] "VXLAN deployment example with hypervisors acting as VTEPs"

In the above example, we have **hypervisors** hosting a **virtual
machines** from different **tenants**. Each virtual machine is given
access to a tenant-specific **virtual Ethernet segment**. Users are
expecting classic Ethernet segments: no MAC restrictions,[^bridge]
total control over the IP addressing scheme they use and availability
of multicast.

[^bridge]: For example, they may use bridges to connect containers
    together.

[TOC]

In a large VXLAN deployment, two aspects need attention:

 1. **discovery of other endpoints** (VTEPs) sharing the same VXLAN segments, and
 2. **avoidance of BUM frames** (broadcast, unknown unicast and
    multicast) as they have to be forwarded to all VTEPs.

A typical solution for the first point is using multicast. For the
second point, this is source-address learning.

# Introduction to BGP EVPN

BGP EVPN ([RFC 7432][] and [RFC 8365][] for its application to VXLAN)
is a standard control protocol to efficiently solves these two aspects
without relying on multicast nor source-address learning.

BGP EVPN relies on BGP ([RFC 4271][]) and its MP-BGP extensions
([RFC 4760][]). **BGP** is the routing protocol powering the
Internet. It is highly scalable and interoperable. It is also
extensible and one of its extension is **MP-BGP**. This extension can
carry reachability information (NLRI) for multiple protocols (IPv4,
IPv6, L3VPN and in our case EVPN). **EVPN** is a special family to
advertise MAC addresses and the remote equipments they are attached
to.

There are two kinds of reachability information a VTEP sends through
BGP EVPN:

 1. the VNIs they have interest in (type 3 routes), and
 2. for each VNI, the local MAC addresses (type 2 routes).

The protocol also covers other aspects of virtual Ethernet segments
(L3 reachability information from ARP/ND caches, MAC mobility and
multi-homing[^multi-homing]) but we won't describe them here.

[^multi-homing]: Such a feature can replace proprietary
    implementations of MC-LAG allowing several VTEPs to act as an
    endpoint for a single link aggregation group. This is not needed
    on our scenario where hypervisors act as VTEPs.

To deploy BGP EVPN, a typical solution is to use several **route
reflectors** (both for redundancy and scalability), like in the
picture below. Each VTEP opens a BGP session to at least two route
reflectors, sends its information (MACs and VNIs) and receives
others'. This reduces the number of BGP sessions to configure.

![VXLAN deployment with route reflectors][i2]
[i2]: [[!!images/vxlan/vxlan-deployment-rr-v2.svg]] "VXLAN deployment example with hypervisors using BGP EVPN with route reflectors"

Compared to [other solutions to deploy VXLAN][VXLAN & Linux], BGP EVPN
has three main advantages:

 - **interoperability** with other vendors (notably Juniper and Cisco);
 - proven **scalability** (a typical BGP routers handle several millions of routes); and
 - possibility to enforce **fine-grained policies**.

On Linux, [FRR][] is a fairly complete implementation of BGP EVPN
(type 3 routes for VTEP discovery, type 2 routes with MAC or IP
addresses, MAC mobility when a host changes from one VTEP to another
one) which requires very little configuration. This is a fork of
[Quagga][] and is used in [Cumulus Linux][], a network operating
system based on Debian powering switches from various brands.[^fork]

!!! "Update (2020-11)" Initially, this article was about *Cumulus
Quagga*. EVPN support was added in FRR 4.0. On *Cumulus Linux*, *FRR*
has replaced *Cumulus Quagga* since version 3.4.0. I have updated this
article to replace mentions of *Cumulus Quagga* by *FRR* to avoid
confusion.

[^fork]: The development of *Quagga* is slow and "closed." New
    features are often stalled. *FRR* is placed under the umbrella of
    the Linux Foundation, has a GitHub-centered development model and
    an election process. It already has several interesting
    enhancements (notably, BGP add-path, BGP unnumbered, MPLS and
    LDP).

# Route reflector setup

Before configuring each VTEP, we need to configure two or more route
reflectors. There are many solutions. I will present three of them:

 - using *FRR*;
 - using *GoBGP*, an implementation of BGP in Go; and
 - using *Juniper Junos*.

For reliability purpose, it's possible (and easy) to use one
implementation for some route reflectors and another implementation
for the other ones.

The proposed configurations are quite minimal. However, it is possible
to centralize policies on the route reflectors (e.g. routes tagged
with some community can only be readvertised to some group of VTEPs).

## Using FRR

The configuration is pretty simple. We suppose the configured route
reflector has `203.0.113.254` configured as a loopback IP.

    ::quagga
    router bgp 65000
      bgp router-id 203.0.113.254
      bgp cluster-id 203.0.113.254
      bgp log-neighbor-changes
      no bgp default ipv4-unicast
      neighbor fabric peer-group
      neighbor fabric remote-as 65000
      neighbor fabric capability extended-nexthop
      neighbor fabric update-source 203.0.113.254
      bgp listen range 203.0.113.0/24 peer-group fabric
      !
      address-family l2vpn evpn
       neighbor fabric activate
       neighbor fabric route-reflector-client
      exit-address-family
      !
    !

A peer group `fabric` is defined and we leverage the dynamic neighbor
feature of *FRR*: we don't have to explicitily define each
neighbor. Any client from `203.0.113.0/24` and presenting itself as
part of AS 65000 can connect. All sent EVPN routes will be accepted
and reflected to the other clients.

You don't need to run *Zebra*, the route engine talking with the
kernel. Instead, start `bgpd` with the `--no_kernel` flag.

!!! "Update (2018-04)" If you need to support several implementations
of BGP EVPN, it is safer to **not** use *FRR* as a route reflector:
it may mangle the received routes.

## Using GoBGP

[GoBGP][] is a clean implementation of BGP in Go.[^go] It exposes an
RPC API for configuration (but accepts a configuration file and comes
with a command-line client). Here is a configuration similar to the
*FRR* one:

    ::yaml
    global:
      config:
        as: 65000
        router-id: 203.0.113.254
        local-address-list:
          - 203.0.113.254
    peer-groups:
      - config:
          peer-group-name: rr-client
          peer-as: 65000
        afi-safis:
          - config:
              afi-safi-name: l2vpn-evpn
        route-reflector:
          config:
            route-reflector-client: true
            route-reflector-cluster-id: 203.0.113.254
    dynamic-neighbors:
      - config:
          peer-group: rr-client
          prefix: 203.0.113.0/24

[^go]: I am unenthusiastic about projects whose the sole purpose is to
    rewrite something in Go. However, while being quite young, *GoBGP*
    is quite valuable on its own (good architecture, good
    performance).

*GoBGP* won't try to interact with the kernel which is fine as a route
reflector.

## Using Juniper Junos

A variety of Juniper products can be a BGP route reflector, notably:

 - the [Juniper QFX5100][],[^qfx] a top-of-the-rack switch;
 - the [Juniper MX240][],[^mx] a high-range router; and
 - the [Juniper vRR][],[^vrr] a virtual appliance running *Junos* without a
   data-plane.

[^qfx]: The 48-port version is around US$10,000 with the BGP license.
[^mx]: An empty chassis with a dual routing engine (RE-S-1800X4-16G) is around US$30,000.
[^vrr]: I don't know how pricey the *vRR* is. For evaluation purposes,
    it can be downloaded for free if you are a customer.

The main factor is the CPU and the memory. The *QFX5100* is low on
memory and won't support large deployments without some additional
policing.

Here is a configuration similar to the *FRR* one:

    ::junos
    interfaces {
        lo0 {
            unit 0 {
                family inet {
                    address 203.0.113.254/32;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    protocols {
        bgp {
            group fabric {
                family evpn {
                    signaling {
                        /* Do not try to install EVPN routes */
                        no-install;
                    }
                }
                type internal;
                cluster 203.0.113.254;
                local-address 203.0.113.254;
                allow 203.0.113.0/24;
            }
        }
    }

    routing-options {
        router-id 203.0.113.254;
        autonomous-system 65000;
    }

# VTEP setup

The next step is to configure each VTEP/hypervisor. Each VXLAN is
locally configured using a bridge for local virtual interfaces, like
illustrated in the below schema. The bridge is taking care of the
local MAC addresses (notably, using source-address learning) and the
VXLAN interface takes care of the remote MAC addresses (received with
BGP EVPN).

![Bridged VXLAN device][i3]
[i3]: [[!!images/vxlan/vxlan-bridge-simple-v2.svg]] "VXLAN device attached to a Linux bridge"

VXLANs can be provisioned with the following script. Source-address
learning is disabled as we will rely solely on BGP EVPN to synchronize
FDBs between the hypervisors.

    ::sh
    for vni in 100 200; do
        # Create VXLAN interface
        ip link add vxlan${vni} type vxlan
            id ${vni} \
            dstport 4789 \
            local 203.0.113.2 \
            nolearning
        # Create companion bridge
        brctl addbr br${vni}
        brctl addif br${vni} vxlan${vni}
        brctl stp br${vni} off
        ip link set up dev br${vni}
        ip link set up dev vxlan${vni}
    done
    # Attach each VM to the appropriate segment
    brctl addif br100 vnet10
    brctl addif br100 vnet11
    brctl addif br200 vnet12

The configuration of *FRR* is similar to the one used for a route
reflector, except we use the `advertise-all-vni` directive to publish
all local VNIs.

    ::quagga hl_lines="14"
    router bgp 65000
      bgp router-id 203.0.113.2
      no bgp default ipv4-unicast
      neighbor fabric peer-group
      neighbor fabric remote-as 65000
      neighbor fabric capability extended-nexthop
      ! BGP sessions with route reflectors
      neighbor 203.0.113.253 peer-group fabric
      neighbor 203.0.113.254 peer-group fabric
      !
      address-family l2vpn evpn
       neighbor fabric activate
       advertise-all-vni
      exit-address-family
      !
    !

If everything works as expected, the instances sharing the same VNI
should be able to ping each other. If IPv6 is enabled on the VMs, the
`ping` command shows if everything is in order:

    ::console
    $ ping -c10 -w1 -t1 ff02::1%eth0
    PING ff02::1%eth0(ff02::1%eth0) 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from fe80::5254:33ff:fe00:8%eth0: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.016 ms
    64 bytes from fe80::5254:33ff:fe00:b%eth0: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=4.98 ms (DUP!)
    64 bytes from fe80::5254:33ff:fe00:9%eth0: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=4.99 ms (DUP!)
    64 bytes from fe80::5254:33ff:fe00:a%eth0: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=4.99 ms (DUP!)

    --- ff02::1%eth0 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, +3 duplicates, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.016/3.745/4.991/2.152 ms

# Verification

Step by step, let's check how everything comes together.

## Getting VXLAN information from the kernel

On each VTEP, *FRR* should be able to retrieve the information
about configured VXLANs. This can be checked with `vtysh`:

    ::console hl_lines="12 13 15"
    # show interface vxlan100
    Interface vxlan100 is up, line protocol is up
      Link ups:       1    last: 2017/04/29 20:01:33.43
      Link downs:     0    last: (never)
      PTM status: disabled
      vrf: Default-IP-Routing-Table
      index 11 metric 0 mtu 1500
      flags: <UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>
      Type: Ethernet
      HWaddr: 62:42:7a:86:44:01
      inet6 fe80::6042:7aff:fe86:4401/64
      Interface Type Vxlan
      VxLAN Id 100
      Access VLAN Id 1
      Master (bridge) ifindex 9 ifp 0x56536e3f3470

The important points are:

 - the VNI is 100; and
 - the bridge device was correctly detected.

*FRR* should also be able to retrieve information about the local
MAC addresses :

    ::console
    # show evpn mac vni 100
    Number of MACs (local and remote) known for this VNI: 2
    MAC               Type   Intf/Remote VTEP      VLAN
    50:54:33:00:00:0a local  eth1.100
    50:54:33:00:00:0b local  eth2.100

## BGP sessions

Each VTEP has to establish a BGP session to the route reflectors. On
the VTEP, this can be checked by running `vtysh`:

    ::console hl_lines="5 15 20"
    # show bgp neighbors 203.0.113.254
    BGP neighbor is 203.0.113.254, remote AS 65000, local AS 65000, internal link
     Member of peer-group fabric for session parameters
      BGP version 4, remote router ID 203.0.113.254
      BGP state = Established, up for 00:00:45
      Neighbor capabilities:
        4 Byte AS: advertised and received
        AddPath:
          L2VPN EVPN: RX advertised L2VPN EVPN
        Route refresh: advertised and received(new)
        Address family L2VPN EVPN: advertised and received
        Hostname Capability: advertised
        Graceful Restart Capabilty: advertised
    […]
     For address family: L2VPN EVPN
      fabric peer-group member
      Update group 1, subgroup 1
      Packet Queue length 0
      Community attribute sent to this neighbor(both)
      8 accepted prefixes

      Connections established 1; dropped 0
      Last reset never
    Local host: 203.0.113.2, Local port: 37603
    Foreign host: 203.0.113.254, Foreign port: 179

The output includes the following information:

 - the BGP state is `Established`;
 - the address family `L2VPN EVPN` is correctly advertised; and
 - 8 routes are received from this route reflector.

The state of the BGP sessions can also be checked from the route
reflectors. With *GoBGP*, use the following command:

    ::console hl_lines="4 10 19"
    # gobgp neighbor 203.0.113.2
    BGP neighbor is 203.0.113.2, remote AS 65000, route-reflector-client
      BGP version 4, remote router ID 203.0.113.2
      BGP state = established, up for 00:04:30
      BGP OutQ = 0, Flops = 0
      Hold time is 9, keepalive interval is 3 seconds
      Configured hold time is 90, keepalive interval is 30 seconds
      Neighbor capabilities:
        multiprotocol:
            l2vpn-evpn:     advertised and received
        route-refresh:      advertised and received
        graceful-restart:   received
        4-octet-as: advertised and received
        add-path:   received
        UnknownCapability(73):      received
        cisco-route-refresh:        received
    […]
      Route statistics:
        Advertised:             8
        Received:               5
        Accepted:               5

With *Junos*, use the below command:

    ::console hl_lines="5 9 37"
    > show bgp neighbor 203.0.113.2

If a BGP session cannot be established, the logs of each BGP daemon
should mention the cause.

## Sent routes

From each VTEP, *FRR* needs to send:

 - one type 3 route for each local VNI; and
 - one type 2 route for each local MAC address.

The best place to check the received routes is on one of the route
reflectors. If you are using *Junos*, the following command will display
the received routes from the provided VTEP:

    ::console
    > show route table bgp.evpn.0 receive-protocol bgp 203.0.113.2

    bgp.evpn.0: 10 destinations, 10 routes (10 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
      Prefix                  Nexthop              MED     Lclpref    AS path
      2:203.0.113.2:100::0::50:54:33:00:00:0a/304 MAC/IP
    *                         203.0.113.2                  100        I
      2:203.0.113.2:100::0::50:54:33:00:00:0b/304 MAC/IP
    *                         203.0.113.2                  100        I
      3:203.0.113.2:100::0::203.0.113.2/304 IM
    *                         203.0.113.2                  100        I
      3:203.0.113.2:200::0::203.0.113.2/304 IM
    *                         203.0.113.2                  100        I

There is one type 3 route for VNI 100 and another one for
VNI 200. There are also two type 2 routes for two MAC addresses on
VNI 100. To get more information, you can add the keyword
`extensive`. Here is a type 3 route advertising `203.0.113.2` as a
VTEP for VNI 100:[^vni100]

    ::console

[^vni100]: The value 100 used in the route distinguishier
    (`203.0.113.2:100`) is not the one used to encode the VNI. The VNI
    is encoded in the route target (`65000:268435556`), in the 24
    least signifiant bits (`268435556 & 0xffffff` equals `100`). As
    long as VNIs are unique, we don't have to understand these
    details.

Here is a type 2 route announcing the location of the
`50:54:33:00:00:0a` MAC address for VNI 100:

## Received routes

Each VTEP should have received the type 2 and type 3 routes from its
fellow VTEPs, through the route reflectors. You can check with the
`show bgp l2vpn evpn route` command of `vtysh`.

Does *FRR* correctly understand the received routes? The type 3
routes are translated to an association between the remote VTEPs and
the VNIs:

    ::console
    # show evpn vni
    Number of VNIs: 2
    VNI        VxLAN IF              VTEP IP         # MACs   # ARPs   Remote VTEPs
    100        vxlan100              203.0.113.2     4        0        203.0.113.3
                                                                       203.0.113.1
    200        vxlan200              203.0.113.2     3        0        203.0.113.3
                                                                       203.0.113.1

The type 2 routes are translated to an association between the remote
MACs and the remote VTEPs:

    ::console hl_lines="4 7"
    # show evpn mac vni 100
    Number of MACs (local and remote) known for this VNI: 4
    MAC               Type   Intf/Remote VTEP      VLAN
    50:54:33:00:00:09 remote 203.0.113.1
    50:54:33:00:00:0a local  eth1.100
    50:54:33:00:00:0b local  eth2.100
    50:54:33:00:00:0c remote 203.0.113.3

## FDB configuration

The last step is to ensure *FRR* has correctly provided the
received information to the kernel. This can be checked with the
`bridge` command:

    ::console
    # bridge fdb show dev vxlan100 | grep dst
    00:00:00:00:00:00 dst 203.0.113.1 self permanent
    00:00:00:00:00:00 dst 203.0.113.3 self permanent
    50:54:33:00:00:0c dst 203.0.113.3 self
    50:54:33:00:00:09 dst 203.0.113.1 self

All good! The first two lines are the translation of the type 3 routes
(any BUM frame will be sent to both `203.0.113.1` and `203.0.113.3`)
and the two last ones are the translation of the type 2 routes.

# Interoperability

One of the strength of BGP EVPN is the interoperability with other
network vendors. To demonstrate it works as expected, we will
configure a [Juniper vMX][] 16.1R1.7 to act as a VTEP.

!!! "Update (2018-04)" You need to add the following patches for *FRR*
unless you use version 6.0 or later: [bgpd: add an option for RT
auto-derivation to use RFC 8635][#2034] and [bgpd: add basic support
for ETI and ESI for BGP EVPN][#2035]. You also need to enable the
`autort rfc8365-compatible` flag in *FRR*.

First, we need to configure the physical
bridge.[^routinginstance] This is similar to the use of `ip link` and
`brctl` with Linux. We only configure one physical interface with two
old-school VLANs paired with matching VNIs.

    ::junos
    interfaces {
        ge-0/0/1 {
            unit 0 {
                family bridge {
                    interface-mode trunk;
                    vlan-id-list [ 100 200 ];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    routing-instances {
        switch {
            instance-type virtual-switch;
            interface ge-0/0/1.0;
            bridge-domains {
                vlan100 {
                    domain-type bridge;
                    vlan-id 100;
                    no-arp-suppression;
                    vxlan {
                        vni 100;
                        # Do not enable "ingress-node-replication"
                    }
                }
                vlan200 {
                    domain-type bridge;
                    vlan-id 200;
                    no-arp-suppression;
                    vxlan {
                        vni 200;
                        # Do not enable "ingress-node-replication"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

[^routinginstance]: On *MX*, the use of a virtual switch is mandatory
    to declare VLANs. A *QFX 10K* doesn't require this and a *QFX 5K*
    doesn't support such a feature.

Then, we configure BGP EVPN to advertise all known VNIs. The
configuration is quite similar to the one we did with *FRR*:

    ::junos
    protocols {
        bgp {
            group fabric {
                type internal;
                multihop;
                family evpn signaling;
                local-address 203.0.113.3;
                neighbor 203.0.113.253;
                neighbor 203.0.113.254;
            }
        }
    }

    routing-instances {
        switch {
            vtep-source-interface lo0.0;
            route-distinguisher 203.0.113.3:1; # ❶
            vrf-target {
                target:65000:1;
                auto;
            }
            protocols {
                evpn {
                    encapsulation vxlan;
                    extended-vni-list all;
                    multicast-mode ingress-replication;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    routing-options {
        router-id 203.0.113.3;
        autonomous-system 65000;
    }

The routes sent by this configuration are very similar to the routes
sent by *FRR*. The main differences are:

 - on *Junos*, the route distinguisher is configured statically (in ❶); and
 - on *Junos*, the VNI is also encoded as an Ethernet tag ID.

Here is a type 3 route, as sent by *Junos*:

    ::console
    > show route table bgp.evpn.0 receive-protocol bgp 203.0.113.3 extensive

    bgp.evpn.0: 13 destinations, 13 routes (13 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)

    […]

We can check that the *vMX* is able to make sense of the routes it
receives from its peers running *FRR*:

    ::console
    > show evpn database l2-domain-id 100
    Instance: switch
    VLAN  DomainId  MAC address        Active source                  Timestamp        IP address

         100        50:54:33:00:00:0d  203.0.113.2                    Apr 30 12:32:42

On the other end, if we look at one of the *FRR*-based VTEP, we can
check the received routes are correctly understood:

    ::console hl_lines="5 15"
    # show evpn vni 100

    50:54:33:00:00:0f remote 203.0.113.3

Get in touch if you have some success with other vendors!

!!! "Update (2018-03)" BGP EVPN is also able to handle multihomed
Ethernet segments: a link aggregate can span over several VTEPs. While
this is supported by *Juniper*, *FRR* does not support such
setup and ignores remote multihomed segments. For more details about a
complete Juniper setup, have a look Alexander Grigorenko's
"[EVPN-VXLAN lab][]" series as well as the [whitepaper from
Juniper][].

!!! "Update (2020-11)" Initial [support for multihoming][] has been
added to *FRR* 7.5. I would advise waiting for a couple of releases
for the feature set to be complete.
