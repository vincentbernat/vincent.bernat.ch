**VXLAN** is an **overlay network** to encapsulate Ethernet traffic
over an existing (highly available and scalable, possibly the
Internet) IP network while accomodating a very large number of
tenants. It is defined in [RFC 7348][]. For an uncut introduction on
its use with Linux, have a look at my "[VXLAN & Linux][]" post.

![VXLAN deployment][i1]
[i1]: [[!!images/vxlan/vxlan-deployment-v2.svg]] "VXLAN deployment example with hypervisors acting as VTEPs"

In the above example, we have **hypervisors** hosting a **virtual
machines** from different **tenants**. Each virtual machine is given
access to a tenant-specific **virtual Ethernet segment**. Users are
expecting classic Ethernet segments: no MAC restrictions[^bridge],
total control over the IP addressing scheme they use and availability
of multicast.

[^bridge]: For example, they may use bridges to connect containers
    together.

[TOC]

In a large VXLAN deployment, two aspects need attention:

 1. **discovery of other endpoints** (VTEPs) sharing the same VXLAN segments, and
 2. **avoidance of BUM frames** (broadcast, unknown unicast and
    multicast) as they have to be forwarded to all VTEPs.

A typical solution for the first point is using multicast. For the
second point, this is source-address learning.

# Introduction to BGP EVPN

BGP EVPN ([RFC 7432][] and [draft-ietf-bess-evpn-overlay][] for its
application to VXLAN) is a standard control protocol to efficiently
solves those two aspects without relying on multicast nor
source-address learning.

BGP EVPN relies on BGP ([RFC 4271][]) and its MP-BGP extensions
([RFC 4760][]). **BGP** is the routing protocol powering the
Internet. It is highly scalable and interoperable. It is also
extensible and one of its extension is **MP-BGP**. This extension can
carry reachability information (NLRI) for multiple protocols (IPv4,
IPv6, L3VPN and in our case EVPN). **EVPN** is a special family to
advertise MAC addresses and the remote equipments they are attached
to.

There are basically two kinds of reachability information a VTEP sends
through BGP EVPN:

 1. the VNIs they have interest in (type 3 routes), and
 2. for each VNI, the local MAC addresses (type 2 routes).

The protocol also covers other aspects of virtual Ethernet segments
(L3 reachability information from ARP/ND caches, MAC mobility and
multi-homing[^multi-homing]) but we won't describe them here.

[^multi-homing]: Such a feature can replace proprietary
    implementations of MC-LAG allowing several VTEPs to act as a
    endpoint for a single link aggregation group. This is not needed
    on our scenario where hypervisors act as VTEPs.

To deploy BGP EVPN, a typical solution is to use several **route
reflectors** (both for redundancy and scalability), like in the
picture below. Each VTEP opens a BGP session to at least two route
reflectors, sends its information (MACs and VNIs) and receives
others'. This reduces the number of BGP sessions to configure.

![VXLAN deployment with route reflectors][i2]
[i2]: [[!!images/vxlan/vxlan-deployment-rr-v2.svg]] "VXLAN deployment example with hypervisors using BGP EVPN with route reflectors"

Compared to [other solutions to deploy VXLAN][VXLAN & Linux], BGP EVPN
has three main advantages:

 - **interoperability** with other vendors (notably Juniper and Cisco),
 - proven **scalability** (a typical BGP routers handle several millions of routes), and
 - possibility to enforce **fine-grained policies**.

On Linux, [Cumulus Quagga][] is a fairly complete implementation of
BGP EVPN (type 3 routes for VTEP discovery, type 2 routes with MAC or
IP addresses, MAC mobility when a host changes from one VTEP to
another one) which requires very little configuration.

This is a fork of [Quagga][] and currently used in [Cumulus Linux][],
a network operating system based on Debian powering switches from
various brands. At some point, BGP EVPN support will be [contributed
back][pr-evpn] to [FRR][], a community-maintained fork of *Quagga*[^fork].

**UPDATED (2017.08):** Cumulus switched from Quagga to [FRR][] (since
Cumulus Linux 3.4.0). The configuration presented here also works with
FRR 3.1 (not released yet).

[^fork]: The development of *Quagga* is slow and "closed". New
    features are often stalled. *FRR* is placed under the umbrella of
    the Linux Foundation, has a GitHub-centered development model and
    an election process. It already has several interesting
    enhancements (notably, BGP add-path, BGP unnumbered, MPLS and
    LDP).

It should be noted the BGP EVPN implementation of *Cumulus Quagga*
currently only supports IPv4.

# Route reflector setup

Before configuring each VTEP, we need to configure two or more route
reflectors. There are many solutions. I will present three of them:

 - using *Cumulus Quagga*,
 - using *GoBGP*, an implementation of BGP in Go,
 - using *Juniper JunOS*.

For reliability purpose, it's possible (and easy) to use one
implementation for some route reflectors and another implementation
for the other ones.

The proposed configurations are quite minimal. However, it is possible
to centralize policies on the route reflectors (e.g. routes tagged
with some community can only be readvertised to some group of VTEPs).

## Using Quagga

The configuration is pretty simple. We suppose the configured route
reflector has `203.0.113.254` configured as a loopback IP.

    ::quagga
    router bgp 65000
      bgp router-id 203.0.113.254
      bgp cluster-id 203.0.113.254
      bgp log-neighbor-changes
      no bgp default ipv4-unicast
      neighbor fabric peer-group
      neighbor fabric remote-as 65000
      neighbor fabric capability extended-nexthop
      neighbor fabric update-source 203.0.113.254
      bgp listen range 203.0.113.0/24 peer-group fabric
      !
      ! With FRR, use: address-family l2vpn evpn
      address-family evpn
       neighbor fabric activate
       neighbor fabric route-reflector-client
      exit-address-family
      !
      exit
    !

A peer group `fabric` is defined and we leverage the dynamic neighbor
feature of *Cumulus Quagga*: we don't have to explicitely define each
neighbor. Any client from `203.0.113.0/24` and presenting itself as
part of AS 65000 can connect. All sent EVPN routes will be accepted
and reflected to the other clients.

You don't need to run *Zebra*, the route engine talking with the
kernel. Instead, start `bgpd` with the `--no_kernel` flag.

## Using GoBGP

[GoBGP][] is a clean implementation of BGP in Go[^go]. It exposes an RPC
API for configuration (but accepts a configuration file and comes with
a command-line client).

[^go]: I am unenthusiastic about projects whose the sole purpose is to
    rewrite something in Go. However, while being quite young, *GoBGP*
    is quite valuable on its own (good architecture, good
    performance).

<del>It doesn't support dynamic
neighbors [yet][gobgp-dynamic-neighbors], but</del>[^dynamic] you can
use the API, the command-line client or some templating language to
automate peer declarations. A configuration with only one neighbor is
like this:

    ::yaml
    global:
      config:
        as: 65000
        router-id: 203.0.113.254
        local-address-list:
          - 203.0.113.254
    neighbors:
      - config:
          neighbor-address: 203.0.113.1
          peer-as: 65000
        afi-safis:
          - config:
              afi-safi-name: l2vpn-evpn
        route-reflector:
          config:
            route-reflector-client: true
            route-reflector-cluster-id: 203.0.113.254

[^dynamic]: Since GoBGP 1.21, dynamic neighbors are supported. Have a
    look at [this configuration example][gobgp-dynamic-neighbors-conf].

[gobgp-dynamic-neighbors-conf]: https://github.com/vincentbernat/network-lab/blob/853ad29b1c5233e028e0d015eeac62b15d6ab16c/lab-vxlan/gobgpd.yaml "Configuration example of GoBGP as a route reflector with dynamic neighbors"

More neighbors can be added from the command line:

    ::console
    $ gobgp neighbor add 203.0.113.2 as 65000 \
    >         route-reflector-client 203.0.113.254 \
    >         --address-family evpn

*GoBGP* won't try to interact with the kernel which is fine as a route
reflector.

## Using Juniper JunOS

A variety of Juniper products can be a BGP route reflector, notably:

 - the [Juniper QFX5100][][^qfx], a top-of-the-rack switch,
 - the [Juniper MX240][][^mx], a high-range router,
 - the [Juniper vRR][][^vrr], a virtual appliance running *JunOS* without a
   data-plane.

[^qfx]: The 48-port version is around $10,000 with the BGP license.
[^mx]: An empty chassis with a dual routing engine (RE-S-1800X4-16G) is around $30,000.
[^vrr]: I don't know how pricey the *vRR* is. For evaluation purposes,
    it can be downloaded for free if you are a customer.

The main factor is the CPU and the memory. The *QFX5100* is low on
memory and won't support large deployments without some additional
policing.

Here is a configuration similar to the *Quagga* one:

    ::junos
    interfaces {
        lo0 {
            unit 0 {
                family inet {
                    address 203.0.113.254/32;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    protocols {
        bgp {
            group fabric {
                family evpn {
                    signaling {
                        /* Do not try to install EVPN routes */
                        no-install;
                    }
                }
                type internal;
                cluster 203.0.113.254;
                local-address 203.0.113.254;
                allow 203.0.113.0/24;
            }
        }
    }
    
    routing-options {
        router-id 203.0.113.254;
        autonomous-system 65000;
    }

# VTEP setup

The next step is to configure each VTEP/hypervisor. Each VXLAN is
locally configured using a bridge for local virtual interfaces, like
illustrated in the below schema. The bridge is taking care of the
local MAC addresses (notably, using source-address learning) and the
VXLAN interface takes care of the remote MAC addresses (received with
BGP EVPN).

![Bridged VXLAN device][i3]
[i3]: [[!!images/vxlan/vxlan-bridge-simple-v2.svg]] "VXLAN device enslaved with a Linux bridge"

VXLANs can be provisioned with the following script. Source-address
learning is disabled as we will rely solely on BGP EVPN to synchronize
FDBs between the hypervisors.

    ::sh
    for vni in 100 200; do
        # Create VXLAN interface
        ip link add vxlan${vni} type vxlan
            id ${vni} \
            dstport 4789 \
            local 203.0.113.2 \
            nolearning
        # Create companion bridge
        brctl addbr br${vni}
        brctl addif br${vni} vxlan${vni}
        brctl stp br${vni} off
        ip link set up dev br${vni}
        ip link set up dev vxlan${vni}
    done
    # Attach each VM to the appropriate segment
    brctl addif br100 vnet10
    brctl addif br100 vnet11
    brctl addif br200 vnet12

The configuration of *Cumulus Quagga* is similar to the one used for a
route reflector, except we use the `advertise-all-vni` directive to
publish all local VNIs.

    ::quagga hl_lines="14"
    router bgp 65000
      bgp router-id 203.0.113.2
      no bgp default ipv4-unicast
      neighbor fabric peer-group
      neighbor fabric remote-as 65000
      neighbor fabric capability extended-nexthop
      neighbor fabric update-source dummy0
      ! BGP sessions with route reflectors
      neighbor 203.0.113.253 peer-group fabric
      neighbor 203.0.113.254 peer-group fabric
      !
      ! With FRR, use: address-family l2vpn evpn
      address-family evpn
       neighbor fabric activate
       advertise-all-vni
      exit-address-family
      !
      exit
    !

If everything works as expected, the instances sharing the same VNI
should be able to ping each other. If IPv6 is enabled on the VMs, the
`ping` command shows if everything is in order:

    ::console
    $ ping -c10 -w1 -t1 ff02::1%eth0
    PING ff02::1%eth0(ff02::1%eth0) 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from fe80::5254:33ff:fe00:8%eth0: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.016 ms
    64 bytes from fe80::5254:33ff:fe00:b%eth0: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=4.98 ms (DUP!)
    64 bytes from fe80::5254:33ff:fe00:9%eth0: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=4.99 ms (DUP!)
    64 bytes from fe80::5254:33ff:fe00:a%eth0: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=4.99 ms (DUP!)
    
    --- ff02::1%eth0 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, +3 duplicates, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.016/3.745/4.991/2.152 ms

# Verification

Step by step, let's check how everything comes together.

## Getting VXLAN information from the kernel

On each VTEP, *Quagga* should be able to retrieve the information
about configured VXLANs. This can be checked with `vtysh`:

    ::console hl_lines="12 13 15"
    # show interface vxlan100
    Interface vxlan100 is up, line protocol is up
      Link ups:       1    last: 2017/04/29 20:01:33.43
      Link downs:     0    last: (never)
      PTM status: disabled
      vrf: Default-IP-Routing-Table
      index 11 metric 0 mtu 1500
      flags: <UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>
      Type: Ethernet
      HWaddr: 62:42:7a:86:44:01
      inet6 fe80::6042:7aff:fe86:4401/64
      Interface Type Vxlan
      VxLAN Id 100
      Access VLAN Id 1
      Master (bridge) ifindex 9 ifp 0x56536e3f3470

The important points are:

 - the VNI is 100, and
 - the bridge device was correctly detected.

*Quagga* should also be able to retrieve information about the local
MAC addresses :

    ::console
    # show evpn mac vni 100
    Number of MACs (local and remote) known for this VNI: 2
    MAC               Type   Intf/Remote VTEP      VLAN
    50:54:33:00:00:0a local  eth1.100
    50:54:33:00:00:0b local  eth2.100

## BGP sessions

Each VTEP has to establish a BGP session to the route reflectors. On
the VTEP, this can be checked by running `vtysh`:

    ::console hl_lines="5 15 20"
    # show bgp neighbors 203.0.113.254
    BGP neighbor is 203.0.113.254, remote AS 65000, local AS 65000, internal link
     Member of peer-group fabric for session parameters
      BGP version 4, remote router ID 203.0.113.254
      BGP state = Established, up for 00:00:45
      Neighbor capabilities:
        4 Byte AS: advertised and received
        AddPath:
          L2VPN EVPN: RX advertised L2VPN EVPN
        Route refresh: advertised and received(new)
        Address family L2VPN EVPN: advertised and received
        Hostname Capability: advertised
        Graceful Restart Capabilty: advertised
    [...]
     For address family: L2VPN EVPN
      fabric peer-group member
      Update group 1, subgroup 1
      Packet Queue length 0
      Community attribute sent to this neighbor(both)
      8 accepted prefixes
    
      Connections established 1; dropped 0
      Last reset never
    Local host: 203.0.113.2, Local port: 37603
    Foreign host: 203.0.113.254, Foreign port: 179

The output includes the following information:

 - the BGP state is `Established`,
 - the address family `L2VPN EVPN` is correctly advertised, and
 - 8 routes are received from this route reflector.

The state of the BGP sessions can also be checked from the route
reflectors. With *GoBGP*, use the following command:

    ::console hl_lines="4 10 19"
    # gobgp neighbor 203.0.113.2
    BGP neighbor is 203.0.113.2, remote AS 65000, route-reflector-client
      BGP version 4, remote router ID 203.0.113.2
      BGP state = established, up for 00:04:30
      BGP OutQ = 0, Flops = 0
      Hold time is 9, keepalive interval is 3 seconds
      Configured hold time is 90, keepalive interval is 30 seconds
      Neighbor capabilities:
        multiprotocol:
            l2vpn-evpn:     advertised and received
        route-refresh:      advertised and received

        4-octet-as: advertised and received
        add-path:   received
        UnknownCapability(73):      received
        cisco-route-refresh:        received
    [...]
      Route statistics:
        Advertised:             8
        Received:               5
        Accepted:               5

With *JunOS*, use the below command:

    ::console hl_lines="5 9 37"
    > show bgp neighbor 203.0.113.2

If a BGP session cannot be established, the logs of each BGP daemon
should mention the cause.

## Sent routes

From each VTEP, *Quagga* needs to send:

 - one type 3 route for each local VNI, and
 - one type 2 route for each local MAC address.

The best place to check the received routes is on one of the route
reflectors. If you are using *JunOS*, the following command will display
the received routes from the provided VTEP:

    ::console
    > show route table bgp.evpn.0 receive-protocol bgp 203.0.113.2
    
    bgp.evpn.0: 10 destinations, 10 routes (10 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
      Prefix                  Nexthop              MED     Lclpref    AS path

There is one type 3 route for VNI 100 and another one for
VNI 200. There are also two type 2 routes for two MAC addresses on
VNI 100. To get more information, you can add the keyword
`extensive`. Here is a type 3 route advertising `203.0.113.2` as a
VTEP for VNI 100[^vni100]:

    ::console
    > show route table bgp.evpn.0 receive-protocol bgp 203.0.113.2 extensive
    
    bgp.evpn.0: 11 destinations, 11 routes (11 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)

    [...]

[^vni100]: The value 100 used in the route distinguishier
    (`203.0.113.2:100`) is not the one used to encode the VNI. The VNI
    is encoded in the route target (`65000:268435556`), in the 24
    least signifiant bits (`268435556 & 0xffffff` equals `100`). As
    long as VNIs are unique, we don't have to understand those
    details.

Here is a type 2 route announcing the location of the
`50:54:33:00:00:0a` MAC address for VNI 100:

    ::console
    > show route table bgp.evpn.0 receive-protocol bgp 203.0.113.2 extensive

## Received routes

Each VTEP should have received the type 2 and type 3 routes from its
fellow VTEPs, through the route reflectors. You can check with the
`show bgp evpn route` command of `vtysh`.

Does *Quagga* correctly understand the received routes? The type 3
routes are translated to an assocation between the remote VTEPs and
the VNIs:

    ::console
    # show evpn vni
    Number of VNIs: 2
    VNI        VxLAN IF              VTEP IP         # MACs   # ARPs   Remote VTEPs
    100        vxlan100              203.0.113.2     4        0        203.0.113.3
                                                                       203.0.113.1
    200        vxlan200              203.0.113.2     3        0        203.0.113.3
                                                                       203.0.113.1

The type 2 routes are translated to an association between the remote
MACs and the remote VTEPs:

    ::console hl_lines="4 7"
    # show evpn mac vni 100
    Number of MACs (local and remote) known for this VNI: 4
    MAC               Type   Intf/Remote VTEP      VLAN
    50:54:33:00:00:09 remote 203.0.113.1
    50:54:33:00:00:0a local  eth1.100
    50:54:33:00:00:0b local  eth2.100
    50:54:33:00:00:0c remote 203.0.113.3

## FDB configuration

The last step is to ensure *Quagga* has correctly provided the
received information to the kernel. This can be checked with the
`bridge` command:

    ::console
    # bridge fdb show dev vxlan100 | grep dst
    00:00:00:00:00:00 dst 203.0.113.1 self permanent
    00:00:00:00:00:00 dst 203.0.113.3 self permanent
    50:54:33:00:00:0c dst 203.0.113.3 self
    50:54:33:00:00:09 dst 203.0.113.1 self

All good! The two first lines are the translation of the type 3 routes
(any BUM frame will be sent to both `203.0.113.1` and `203.0.113.3`)
and the two last ones are the translation of the type 2 routes.

# Interoperability

One of the strength of BGP EVPN is the interoperability with other
network vendors. To demonstrate it works as expected, we will
configure a [Juniper vMX][] to act as a VTEP.

First, we need to configure the physical
bridge[^routinginstance]. This is similar to the use of `ip link` and
`brctl` with Linux. We only configure one physical interface with two
old-school VLANs paired with matching VNIs.

    ::junos
    interfaces {
        ge-0/0/1 {
            unit 0 {
                family bridge {
                    interface-mode trunk;
                    vlan-id-list [ 100 200 ];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    routing-instances {
        switch {
            instance-type virtual-switch;
            interface ge-0/0/1.0;
            bridge-domains {
                vlan100 {
                    domain-type bridge;
                    vlan-id 100;
                    vxlan {
                        vni 100;
                        ingress-node-replication;
                    }
                }
                vlan200 {
                    domain-type bridge;
                    vlan-id 200;
                    vxlan {
                        vni 200;
                        ingress-node-replication;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

[^routinginstance]: For some reason, the use of a virtual switch is
    mandatory. This is specific to this platform: a *QFX* doesn't
    require this.

Then, we configure BGP EVPN to advertise all known VNIs. The
configuration is quite similar to the one we did with *Quagga*:

    ::junos
    protocols {
        bgp {
            group fabric {
                type internal;
                multihop;
                family evpn signaling;
                local-address 203.0.113.3;
                neighbor 203.0.113.253;
                neighbor 203.0.113.254;
            }
        }
    }
    
    routing-instances {
        switch {
            vtep-source-interface lo0.0;
            route-distinguisher 203.0.113.3:1; # ❶
            vrf-import EVPN-VRF-VXLAN;
            vrf-target {
                target:65000:1;
                auto;
            }
            protocols {
                evpn {
                    encapsulation vxlan;
                    extended-vni-list all;
                    multicast-mode ingress-replication;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    routing-options {
        router-id 203.0.113.3;
        autonomous-system 65000;
    }
    
    policy-options {
        policy-statement EVPN-VRF-VXLAN {
            then accept;
        }
    }

We also need a [small compatibility patch][patch1] for *Cumulus
Quagga*[^whypatch].

[^whypatch]: The encoding of the VNI into the route target is being
    standardized in [draft-ietf-bess-evpn-overlay][]. Juniper already
    implements this draft.

The routes sent by this configuration are very similar to the routes
sent by Quagga. The main differences are:

 - on *JunOS*, the route distinguisher is configured statically (in ❶), and
 - on *JunOS*, the VNI is also encoded as an Ethernet tag ID.

Here is a type 3 route, as sent by *JunOS*:

    ::console
    > show route table bgp.evpn.0 receive-protocol bgp 203.0.113.3 extensive
    
    bgp.evpn.0: 13 destinations, 13 routes (13 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
    * 3:203.0.113.3:1::100::203.0.113.3/304 IM (1 entry, 1 announced)

         PMSI: Flags 0x0: Label 6: Type INGRESS-REPLICATION 203.0.113.3
    [...]

Here is a type 2 route:

    ::console
    > show route table bgp.evpn.0 receive-protocol bgp 203.0.113.3 extensive
    
    bgp.evpn.0: 13 destinations, 13 routes (13 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
    * 2:203.0.113.3:1::200::50:54:33:00:00:0f/304 MAC/IP (1 entry, 1 announced)

         AS path: I
         Communities: target:65000:268435656 encapsulation:vxlan(0x8)
    [...]

We can check that the *vMX* is able to make sense of the routes it
receives from its peers running *Quagga*:

    ::console
    > show evpn database l2-domain-id 100
    Instance: switch
    VLAN  DomainId  MAC address        Active source                  Timestamp        IP address
         100        50:54:33:00:00:0c  203.0.113.1                    Apr 30 12:46:20
         100        50:54:33:00:00:0d  203.0.113.2                    Apr 30 12:32:42
         100        50:54:33:00:00:0e  203.0.113.2                    Apr 30 12:46:20
         100        50:54:33:00:00:0f  ge-0/0/1.0                     Apr 30 12:45:55

On the other end, if we look at one of the *Quagga*-based VTEP, we can
check the received routes are correctly understood:

    ::console hl_lines="5 15"
    # show evpn vni 100
