Here are the slides I presented for [FRnOG #36][] in September 2022.
They are about [Akvorado][], a tool to collect network flows and
visualize them. It was developed by [Free][]. I didn't get time to
publish a blog post yet, but it should happen soon!

The presentation, in French, was recorded. I have added English
subtitles.
