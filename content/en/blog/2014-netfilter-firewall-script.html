A common way to build a firewall ruleset is to run a shell script
calling `iptables` and `ip6tables`. This is convenient since you get
access to variables and loops. There are three major drawbacks with this
method:

 1. While the script is running, the **firewall is temporarily
    incomplete**. Even if existing connections can be arranged to be
    left untouched, the new ones may not be allowed to be established
    (or unauthorized flows may be allowed). Also, essential NAT rules
    or mangling rules may be absent.
 
 2. If an error occurs, you are **left with a half-working
    firewall**. Therefore, you should ensure that some rules
    authorizing remote access are set very early. Or implement some
    kind of automatic rollback system.

 3. Building a **large firewall can be slow**. Each `ip{,6}tables`
    command will download the ruleset from the kernel, add the rule
    and upload the whole modified ruleset to the kernel.

# Using `iptables-restore`

A classic way to solve these problems is to build a rule file that will be
read by `iptables-restore` and
`ip6tables-restore`.[^iptables-apply] These tools send the ruleset to
the kernel in one pass. The kernel applies it atomically. Usually,
such a file is built with `ip{,6}tables-save` but a script can fit the
task.

!!! "Update (2016-04)" Also have a look at
[ferm](http://ferm.foo-projects.org/), a tool to maintain complex
firewalls.

[^iptables-apply]: Another nifty tool is `iptables-apply` which will
                   apply a rule file and rollback after a given
                   timeout unless the change is confirmed by the user.

The ruleset syntax understood by `ip{,6}tables-restore` is similar to
the syntax of `ip{,6}tables` but each table has its own block and
chain declaration is different. See the following example:

    ::console
    $ iptables -P FORWARD DROP
    $ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
    $ iptables -N SSH
    $ iptables -A SSH -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
    $ iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    $ iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
    $ iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    $ iptables -A FORWARD -j SSH
    $ iptables-save
    *nat
    :PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
    :INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
    :OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
    :POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
    -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
    COMMIT

    *filter
    :INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
    :FORWARD DROP [0:0]
    :OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
    :SSH - [0:0]
    -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD -j SSH
    -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
    -A SSH -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
    COMMIT

As you see, we have one block for the `nat` table and one
block for the `filter` table. The user-defined chain `SSH` is
declared at the top of the `filter` block with other builtin
chains.

Here is a script diverting `ip{,6}tables` commands to build such a
file—heavily relying on some [Zsh][]-fu:[^zsh]

    ::sh
    #!/bin/zsh
    set -e
    
    work=$(mktemp -d)
    trap "rm -rf $work" EXIT

    # ❶ Redefine ip{,6}tables
    iptables() {
        # Intercept -t
        local table="filter"
        [[ -n ${@[(r)-t]} ]] && {
            # Which table?
            local index=${(k)@[(r)-t]}
            table=${@[(( index + 1 ))]}
            argv=( $argv[1,(( $index - 1 ))] $argv[(( $index + 2 )),$#] )
        }
        [[ -n ${@[(r)-N]} ]] && {
            # New user chain
            local index=${(k)@[(r)-N]}
            local chain=${@[(( index + 1 ))]}
            print ":${chain} -" >> ${work}/${0}-${table}-userchains
            return
        }
        [[ -n ${@[(r)-P]} ]] && {
            # Policy for a builtin chain
            local index=${(k)@[(r)-P]}
            local chain=${@[(( index + 1 ))]}
            local policy=${@[(( index + 2 ))]}
            print ":${chain} ${policy}" >> ${work}/${0}-${table}-policy
            return
        }
        # iptables-restore only handle double quotes
        echo ${${(q-)@}//\'/\"} >> ${work}/${0}-${table}-rules #'
    }
    functions[ip6tables]=${functions[iptables]}
    
    # ❷ Build the final ruleset that can be parsed by ip{,6}tables-restore
    save() {
        for table (${work}/${1}-*-rules(:t:s/-rules//)) {
            print "*${${table}#${1}-}"
            [ ! -f ${work}/${table}-policy ] || cat ${work}/${table}-policy
            [ ! -f ${work}/${table}-userchains || cat ${work}/${table}-userchains
            cat ${work}/${table}-rules
            print "COMMIT"
        }
    }

    # ❸ Execute rule files
    for rule in $(run-parts --list --regex '^[.a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$' ${0%/*}/rules); do
        . $rule
    done

    # ❹ Execute rule files
    ret=0
    save iptables  | iptables-restore  || ret=$?
    save ip6tables | ip6tables-restore || ret=$?
    exit $ret

[^zsh]: As you can see in the snippet, *Zsh* comes with some powerful
        features to handle arrays. Another big advantage of *Zsh* is
        it does not require quoting every variable to avoid word
        splitting. Hence, the script can handle values with spaces
        without a problem, making it far more robust.

In ❶, a new `iptables()` function is defined and will shadow the
`iptables` command. It will try to locate the `-t` parameter to know
which table should be used. If such a parameter exists, the table is
remembered in the `$table` variable and removed from the list of
arguments. Defining a new chain (with `-N`) is also handled as well as
setting the policy (with `-P`).

In ❷, the `save()` function will output a ruleset that should be
parseable by `ip{,6}tables-restore`. In ❸, user rules are
executed. Each `ip{,6}tables` command will call the previously defined
function. When no error has occurred, in ❹, `ip{,6}tables-restore` is
invoked. The command will either succeed or fail.

This method works just fine.[^nitpick] However, the second method is
more elegant.

[^nitpick]: If I were nitpicking, there are three small flaws with
            it. First, when an error occurs, it can be difficult to
            match the appropriate location in your script since you
            get the position in the ruleset instead.  Second, a table
            can be used before it is defined. So, it may be difficult
            to spot some copy/paste errors. Third, the IPv4 firewall
            may fail while the IPv6 firewall is applied, and
            vice-versa. These flaws are not present in the next
            method.

# Using a network namespace

A hybrid approach is to build the firewall rules with `ip{,6}tables`
in a newly created network namespace, save it with `ip{,6}tables-save`
and apply it in the main namespace with `ip{,6}tables-restore`. Here
is the gist (still using [Zsh][] syntax):

    ::sh
    #!/bin/zsh
    set -e
    
    alias main='/bin/true ||'
    [ -n $iptables ] || {
        # ❶ Execute ourself in a dedicated network namespace
        iptables=1 unshare --net -- \
            $0 4> >(iptables-restore) 6> >(ip6tables-restore)
        # ❷ In main namespace, disable iptables/ip6tables commands
        alias iptables=/bin/true
        alias ip6tables=/bin/true
        alias main='/bin/false ||'
    }
    
    # ❸ In both namespaces, execute rule files
    for rule in $(run-parts --list --regex '^[.a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$' ${0%/*}/rules); do
        . $rule
    done
    
    # ❹ In test namespace, save the rules
    [ -z $iptables ] || {
        iptables-save >&4
        ip6tables-save >&6
    }

In ❶, the current script is executed in a **new network
namespace**. Such a namespace has its own ruleset that can be modified
without altering the one in the main namespace. The `$iptables`
environment variable tell in which namespace we are. In the new
namespace, we execute all the rule files (❸). They contain classic
`ip{,6}tables` commands. If an error occurs, we stop here and nothing
happens, thanks to the use of `set -e`. Otherwise, in ❹, the ruleset
of the new namespace are saved using `ip{,6}tables-save` and sent to
dedicated file descriptors.

Now, the execution in the main namespace resumes in ❶. The results of
`ip{,6}tables-save` are fed to `ip{,6}tables-restore`. At this
point, the firewall is mostly operational. However, we will play again
the rule files (❸) but the `ip{,6}tables` commands will be disabled
(❷). Additional commands in the rule files, like enabling IP
forwarding, will be executed.

The new namespace does not provide the same environment as the main
namespace. For example, there is no network interface in it, so we
cannot get or set IP addresses. A command that must not be executed in
the new namespace should be prefixed by `main`:

    ::sh
    main ip addr add 192.168.15.1/24 dev lan-guest
