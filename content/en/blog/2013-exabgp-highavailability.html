When it comes to provide redundant services, several options are
available:

 - The service can be hosted behind a set of **load-balancers**. They
   will detect any faulty node. However, you need to ensure that this
   new layer is also fault-tolerant.
 - The nodes providing the service can rely on **IP failover** to
   share a set of IP using protocols like VRRP[^vrrp] or CARP. The IP
   address of a faulty node will be assigned to another node. This
   requires all nodes to be part of the same IP subnet.
 - The clients of the service can ask a third-party for available
   nodes. Usually, this is achieved through **round-robin DNS** where
   only working nodes are advertised in a DNS record. The failover
   can be quite long because of caches.

[^vrrp]: The primary target of VRRP is to make a default gateway for
         an IP network highly available by exposing a virtual router
         which is an abstract representation of multiple routers. The
         virtual IP address is held by the master router and any
         backup router can be promoted to master in case of a
         failure. In practice, VRRP can be used to achieve high
         availability of services too.

A common setup is a combination of those solutions: web servers are
behind a couple of load-balancers achieving both redundancy and
load-balancing. The load-balancers use VRRP to ensure redundancy. The
whole setup is replicated to another datacenter and round-robin DNS
is used to ensure both redundancy and load-balacing of the datacenters.

There is a fourth option which is similar to VRRP but relies on
dynamic routing and therefore is not limited to nodes in the same
subnet:

 - The nodes advertise their availability with **BGP** to announce the
   set of service IP addresses they are able to serve. Each address is
   weighted such that IP addresses are balanced among the available
   nodes.

We will explore how to implement this fourth option using [ExaBGP][],
the BGP swiss army knife of networking, in a small lab
[based on KVM][]. You can grab the
[complete lab from GitHub][lab]. _ExaBGP_ 3.2.5 is needed to run this
lab.

[TOC]

# Environment

We will be working in the following (IPv6-only) environment:

![Lab with three web nodes][1]
[1]: [[!!images/exabgp/lab.png]] "Basic routed network with three web nodes"

## BGP configuration

BGP is enabled on _ER2_ and _ER3_ to exchange routes with peers and
transits (only _R1_ for this lab). [BIRD][] is used as a BGP
daemon. Its configuration is pretty basic. Here is a fragment:

    ::nginx
    router id 1.1.1.2;
    
    protocol static NETS { # ➊
      import all;
      export none;
      route 2001:db8::/40 reject;
    }
    protocol bgp R1 { # ➋
      import all;
      export where proto = "NETS";
      local as 64496;
      neighbor 2001:db8:1000::1 as 64511;
    }
    protocol bgp ER3 { # ➌
      import all;
      export all;
      next hop self;
      local as 64496;
      neighbor 2001:db8:1::3 as 64496;
    }

First, in ➊, we declare the routes that we want to export to our
peers. We don't try to summarize them from the IGP. We just
unconditonnaly export the networks that we own. Then, in ➋, _R1_ is
defined as a neighbor and we export the static route we declared
previously. We import any route that _R1_ is willing to send us. In ➌,
we share everything we know with our pal, _ER3_, using internal
BGP.

## OSPF configuration

OSPF will distribute routes inside the AS. It is enabled on _ER2_,
_ER3_, _DR6_, _DR7_ and _DR8_. For example, here is the relevant part
of the configuration of _DR6_:

    ::nginx
    router id 1.1.1.6;
    protocol kernel {
       persist;
       import none;
       export all;
    }
    protocol ospf INTERNAL {
      import all;
      export none;
      area 0.0.0.0 {
        networks {
          2001:db8:1::/64;
          2001:db8:6::/64;
        };
        interface "eth0";
        interface "eth1" { stub yes; };
      };
    }

_ER2_ and _ER3_ **inject a default route** into OSPF:

    ::nginx
    protocol static DEFAULT {
      import all;
      export none;
      route ::/0 via 2001:db8:1000::1;
    }
    filter default_route {
      if proto = "DEFAULT" then accept;
      reject;
    }
    protocol ospf INTERNAL {
      import all;
      export filter default_route;
      area 0.0.0.0 {
        networks {
          2001:db8:1::/64;
        };
        interface "eth1";
      };
    }

## Web nodes

The web nodes are pretty basic. They have a default static route to
the nearest router and that's all. The interesting thing here is that
they are each on a **separate IP subnet**: we cannot share an IP using
VRRP[^vxlan].

Why are those web servers on different subnets? Maybe they are not in
the same datacenter or maybe your network architecture is using a
[routed access layer][].

Let's see how to use BGP to enable redundancy of those web nodes.

[^vxlan]: However, you could deploy an L2 overlay network using, for
          example, [VXLAN][] and use VRRP on it.

# Redundancy with ExaBGP

[ExaBGP][] is a convenient tool to plug scripts into BGP. They can
then **receive and advertise routes**. _ExaBGP_ does the hard work of
speaking BGP with your routers. The scripts just have to read routes
from standard input or advertise them on standard output.

## The big picture

Here is the big picture:

![Using ExaBGP to advertise web services][2]
[2]: [[!!images/exabgp/lab-with-rs.png]] "High availability using ExaBGP and two route servers"

Let's explain it step by step:

 1. **Three IP addresses** will be allocated for our web service:
    `2001:db8:30::1`, `2001:db8:30::2` and `2001:db8:30::3`. Those are
    distinct from the real IP addresses of _W1_, _W2_ and _W3_.

 2. Each **web node will advertise all of them** to the route servers
    we added in the network. I will talk more about those route
    servers later.

 3. Each route comes with a metric to help the route server
    choose where it should be routed. We choose the metrics such that
    each IP address will be routed to a distinct web node (unless
    there is a problem).

 4. The **route servers** (which are not routers) will then advertise the
    **best routes** they learned to all the routers in our network. This
    is still done using BGP.

 5. Now, for a given IP address, each router knows to which web node
    the traffic should be directed.

Here are the respective metrics announced routes for _W1_, _W2_ and
_W3_ when everything works as expected:

Route          | W1  | W2  | W3      | Best   | Backup
-------------- | --- | --- | ------- | ------ | -------
2001:db8:30::1 | 102 | 101 | **100** | **W3** | W2
2001:db8:30::2 | 101 | **100** | 102 | **W2** | W1
2001:db8:30::3 | **100** | 102 | 101 | **W1** | W3

## ExaBGP configuration

The configuration of _ExaBGP_ is quite simple:

    ::nginx
    group rs {
      neighbor 2001:db8:1::4 {
        router-id 1.1.1.11;
        local-address 2001:db8:6::11;
        local-as 65001;
        peer-as 65002;
      }
      neighbor 2001:db8:8::5 {
        router-id 1.1.1.11;
        local-address 2001:db8:6::11;
        local-as 65001;
        peer-as 65002;
      }
    
      process watch-nginx {
          run /usr/bin/python /lab/healthcheck.py -s --config /lab/healthcheck-nginx.conf --start-ip 0;
      }
    }

A script is entailed to check if the service (an _nginx_ web server)
is up and running and advertise the appropriate IP addresses to the
two declared route servers. If we run the script manually, we can see
the advertised routes:

    ::console
    $ python /lab/healthcheck.py --config /lab/healthcheck-nginx.conf --start-ip 0
    INFO[healthcheck] send announces for UP state to ExaBGP
    announce route 2001:db8:30::3/128 next-hop self med 100
    announce route 2001:db8:30::2/128 next-hop self med 101
    announce route 2001:db8:30::1/128 next-hop self med 102
    [...]
    WARNING[healthcheck] Check command was unsuccessful: 7
    INFO[healthcheck] Output of check command:  curl: (7) Failed connect to ip6-localhost:80; Connection refused
    WARNING[healthcheck] Check command was unsuccessful: 7
    INFO[healthcheck] Output of check command:  curl: (7) Failed connect to ip6-localhost:80; Connection refused
    WARNING[healthcheck] Check command was unsuccessful: 7
    INFO[healthcheck] Output of check command:  curl: (7) Failed connect to ip6-localhost:80; Connection refused
    INFO[healthcheck] send announces for DOWN state to ExaBGP
    announce route 2001:db8:30::3/128 next-hop self med 1000
    announce route 2001:db8:30::2/128 next-hop self med 1001
    announce route 2001:db8:30::1/128 next-hop self med 1002

When the service becomes unresponsive, the healthcheck script detect
the situation and retry several times before acknowledging that the
service is dead. Then, the IP addresses are advertised with higher
metrics and the service will be routed to another node (the one
advertising `2001:db8:30::3/128` with metric 101).

This healthcheck script is now part of _ExaBGP_.

## Route servers

We could have connected our _ExaBGP_ servers directly to each
router. However, if you have 20 routers and 10 web servers, you now
have to manage a mesh of 200 sessions. The route servers are here
for three purposes:

 1. Reduce the **number of BGP sessions** (from 200 to 60) between
    equipments (less configuration, less errors).

 2. Avoid modifying the **configuration on routers** each time a new
    service is added.

 3. **Separate** the routing decision (the route servers) from the
    routing process (the routers).

You may also ask yourself: "why not use OSPF?". Good question!

 - OSPF could be enabled on each web node and the IP addresses
   advertised using this protocol. However, OSPF has several
   drawbacks: it does not scale, there are restrictions on the allowed
   topologies, it is difficult to filter routes inside OSPF and a
   misconfiguration will likely impact the whole network. Therefore,
   it is considered a good practice to limit OSPF to network
   equipments.

 - The routes learned by the route servers could be injected into
   OSPF. On paper, OSPF has a "next-hop" field to provide an explicit
   next-hop. This would be handy as we wouldn't have to configure
   adjacencies with each router. However, I have absolutely no idea
   how to inject BGP next-hop into OSPF next-hop. What happens is that
   BGP next-hop is resolved locally using OSPF routes. For example, if
   we inject BGP routes into OSPF from _RS4_, _RS4_ will know the
   appropriate next-hop but other routers will route the traffic to
   _RS4_.

Let's look at how to configure our route servers. _RS4_ will use
_BIRD_ while _RS5_ will use [Quagga][]. Using two different
implementations will help with resiliency by avoiding a bug to hit the
two route servers at the same time.

### Bird configuration

There are two sides for BGP configuration: the BGP sessions with the
_ExaBGP_ nodes and the ones with the routers. Here is the
configuration for the later:

    ::nginx
    template bgp INFRABGP {
      export all;
      import none;
      local as 65002;
      rs client;
    }
    protocol bgp ER2 from INFRABGP {
      neighbor 2001:db8:1::2 as 65003;
    }
    protocol bgp ER3 from INFRABGP {
      neighbor 2001:db8:1::3 as 65003;
    }
    protocol bgp DR6 from INFRABGP {
      neighbor 2001:db8:1::6 as 65003;
    }
    protocol bgp DR7 from INFRABGP {
      neighbor 2001:db8:1::7 as 65003;
    }
    protocol bgp DR8 from INFRABGP {
      neighbor 2001:db8:1::8 as 65003;
    }

The AS number used by our route server is 65002 while the AS number
used for routers is 65003 (the AS numbers for web nodes will be
65001). They are reserved for private use by [RFC 6996][]. All routes
known by the route server are exported to the routers but no routes
are accepted from them.

Let's have a look at the other side:

    ::nginx
    # Only import loopback IPs
    filter only_loopbacks { # ➊
      if net ~ [ 2001:db8:30::/64{128,128} ] then accept;
      reject;
    }
    
    # General template for an EXABGP node
    template bgp EXABGP {
      local as 65002;
      import filter only_loopbacks; # ➋
      export none;
      route limit 10; # ➌
      rs client;
      hold time 6; # ➍
      multihop 10;
      igp table internal;
    }
    
    protocol bgp W1 from EXABGP {
      neighbor 2001:db8:6::11 as 65001;
    }
    protocol bgp W2 from EXABGP {
      neighbor 2001:db8:7::12 as 65001;
    }
    protocol bgp W3 from EXABGP {
      neighbor 2001:db8:8::13 as 65001;
    }

To ensure separation of concerns, we are being a bit more picky. With
➊ and ➋, we only accept loopback addresses and only if they are
contained in the subnet that we reserved for this use. No server
should be able to inject arbitrary addresses into our network. With ➌,
we also limit the number of routes that a server can advertise.

With ➍, we reduce the hold time from 240 to 6. It means that after 6
seconds, the peer is considered dead. This is quite important to be
able to recover quickly from a dead machine. The minimal value
is 3. We could have use a similar setting with the session with the
routers.

### Quagga configuration

Quagga's configuration is a bit more verbose but should be strictly equivalent:

    ::raw
    router bgp 65002 view EXABGP
     bgp router-id 1.1.1.5
     bgp log-neighbor-changes
     no bgp default ipv4-unicast
    
     neighbor R peer-group
     neighbor R remote-as 65003
     neighbor R ebgp-multihop 10
    
     neighbor EXABGP peer-group
     neighbor EXABGP remote-as 65001
     neighbor EXABGP ebgp-multihop 10
     neighbor EXABGP timers 2 6
    !
     address-family ipv6
    
     neighbor R activate
     neighbor R soft-reconfiguration inbound
     neighbor R route-server-client
     neighbor R route-map R-IMPORT import
     neighbor R route-map R-EXPORT export
     neighbor 2001:db8:1::2 peer-group R
     neighbor 2001:db8:1::3 peer-group R
     neighbor 2001:db8:1::6 peer-group R
     neighbor 2001:db8:1::7 peer-group R
     neighbor 2001:db8:1::8 peer-group R
    
     neighbor EXABGP activate
     neighbor EXABGP soft-reconfiguration inbound
     neighbor EXABGP maximum-prefix 10
     neighbor EXABGP route-server-client
     neighbor EXABGP route-map RSCLIENT-IMPORT import
     neighbor EXABGP route-map RSCLIENT-EXPORT export
     neighbor 2001:db8:6::11 peer-group EXABGP
     neighbor 2001:db8:7::12 peer-group EXABGP
     neighbor 2001:db8:8::13 peer-group EXABGP
    
     exit-address-family
    !
    ipv6 prefix-list LOOPBACKS seq 5 permit 2001:db8:30::/64 ge 128 le 128
    ipv6 prefix-list LOOPBACKS seq 10 deny any
    !
    route-map RSCLIENT-IMPORT deny 10
    !
    route-map RSCLIENT-EXPORT permit 10
      match ipv6 address prefix-list LOOPBACKS
    !
    route-map R-IMPORT permit 10
    !
    route-map R-EXPORT deny 10
    !

The view is here to not install routes in the kernel[^view].

[^view]: I have been told on the _Quagga_ mailing-list that such a
         setup is quite uncommon and that it would be better to not
         use views but use `--no_kernel` flag for `bgpd` instead. You
         may want to look at the [whole thread][t1] for more details.

[t1]: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.network.quagga.user/13088

## Routers

Configuring _BIRD_ to receive routes from route servers is
straightforward:

    ::nginx
    # BGP with route servers
    protocol bgp RS4 {
      import all;
      export none;
      local as 65003;
      neighbor 2001:db8:1::4 as 65002;
      gateway recursive;
    }
    protocol bgp RS5 {
      import all;
      export none;
      local as 65003;
      neighbor 2001:db8:8::5 as 65002;
      multihop 4;
      gateway recursive;
    }

It is important to set `gateway recursive` because most of the time,
the next-hop is not reachable directly. In this case, by default,
_BIRD_ will use the IP address of the advertising router (the route
servers).

## Testing

Let's check that everything works as expected. Here is the view from _RS5_:

    ::console
    # show ipv6  bgp  
    BGP table version is 0, local router ID is 1.1.1.5
    Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, i - internal,

                        2001:db8:6::11         102             0 65001 i
    *>                  2001:db8:8::13         100             0 65001 i
    *                   2001:db8:7::12         101             0 65001 i
    *  2001:db8:30::2/128
                        2001:db8:6::11         101             0 65001 i
    *                   2001:db8:8::13         102             0 65001 i
    *>                  2001:db8:7::12         100             0 65001 i
    *> 2001:db8:30::3/128
                        2001:db8:6::11         100             0 65001 i
    *                   2001:db8:8::13         101             0 65001 i
    *                   2001:db8:7::12         102             0 65001 i
    
    Total number of prefixes 3

For example, traffic to `2001:db8:30::2` should be routed through
`2001:db8:7::12` (which is _W2_). Other IP are affected to _W1_ and
_W3_.

_RS4_ should see the same thing[^output]:

    ::console
    $ birdc6 show route 
    BIRD 1.3.11 ready.
    2001:db8:30::1/128 [W3 22:07 from 2001:db8:8::13] * (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       [W1 23:34 from 2001:db8:6::11] (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       [W2 22:07 from 2001:db8:7::12] (100/20) [AS65001i]
    2001:db8:30::2/128 [W2 22:07 from 2001:db8:7::12] * (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       [W1 23:34 from 2001:db8:6::11] (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       [W3 22:07 from 2001:db8:8::13] (100/20) [AS65001i]
    2001:db8:30::3/128 [W1 23:34 from 2001:db8:6::11] * (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       [W3 22:07 from 2001:db8:8::13] (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       [W2 22:07 from 2001:db8:7::12] (100/20) [AS65001i]

[^output]: The output of `birdc6` shows both the next-hop as
           advertised in BGP and the resolved next-hop if the route
           have to be exported into another protocol. I have
           simplified the output to avoid confusion.

Let's have a look at _DR6_:

    ::console
    $ birdc6 show route
    2001:db8:30::1/128 via fe80::5054:56ff:fe6e:98a6 on eth0 * (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       via fe80::5054:56ff:fe6e:98a6 on eth0 (100/20) [AS65001i]
    2001:db8:30::2/128 via fe80::5054:60ff:fe02:3681 on eth0 * (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       via fe80::5054:60ff:fe02:3681 on eth0 (100/20) [AS65001i]
    2001:db8:30::3/128 via 2001:db8:6::11 on eth1 * (100/10) [AS65001i]
                       via 2001:db8:6::11 on eth1 (100/10) [AS65001i]

So, `2001:db8:30::3` is owned by `W1` which is behind `DR6` while the
two others are in another part of the network and will be reached
through the appropriate link-local addresses learned by OSPF.

Let's kill `W1` by stopping _nginx_. A few seconds later, _DR6_ learns
the new routes:

    ::console
    $ birdc6 show route
    2001:db8:30::1/128 via fe80::5054:56ff:fe6e:98a6 on eth0 * (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       via fe80::5054:56ff:fe6e:98a6 on eth0 (100/20) [AS65001i]
    2001:db8:30::2/128 via fe80::5054:60ff:fe02:3681 on eth0 * (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       via fe80::5054:60ff:fe02:3681 on eth0 (100/20) [AS65001i]
    2001:db8:30::3/128 via fe80::5054:56ff:fe6e:98a6 on eth0 * (100/20) [AS65001i]
                       via fe80::5054:56ff:fe6e:98a6 on eth0 (100/20) [AS65001i]
