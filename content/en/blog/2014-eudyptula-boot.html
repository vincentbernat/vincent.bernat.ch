One of the first tasks of this quite interesting challenge is to
compile and boot your own kernel. [`eudyptula-boot`][eudyptula-boot]
is a self-contained shell script to boot any kernel image to a
shell. It is packed with the following features:

 - It boots almost **any Linux kernel**, from distribution-provided
   kernels to custom kernels[^9p] built to hack on some feature.

 - It uses the **host root filesystem** as the guest root
   filesystem. No disk images are needed as they take a lot of space,
   need to be maintained, become cluttered and the tools you need the
   most are never installed. To avoid any alteration, by default, the
   host filesystem is mounted read-only. If available, [OverlayFS][]
   or [aufs][] are used to add a writable overlay on top of it. It
   is also possible to use any directory as the root filesystem.

 - Your **home directory** is also available. This provides hassle-free
   sharing of scripts and results with the host system.

 - It starts a **minimal system**. Only the bits needed to start a
   shell will be involved.[^minimal] The whole system is able to boot
   in less than 5 seconds.

[^9p]: The only requirement is to have [9p virtio][] support
       enabled. This can easily be enabled with `make kvmconfig`.

[^minimal]: Only `udev` is started.

In the following video, `eudyptula-boot` is used to boot the host
kernel and execute a few commands:

In the next one, we use it to boot a custom kernel with an additional
system call. This is the fifteenth task of the
[Eudyptula Challenge][]. A test program is used to check that the
system call is working as expected. Additionally, we demonstrate how to
[attach a debugger][debugging] to the running kernel.

While this hack could be used to run containers[^containers] with an
increased isolation, the performance of the *9p* filesystem is
unfortunately quite poor.

[virtme-ng][] is a similar project.

[^containers]: A good way to start a container is to combine `--root`, `--force`
               and `--exec` parameters. Add `--readwrite` to the mix if you want
               to keep the modifications.
