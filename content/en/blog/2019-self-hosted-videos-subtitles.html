  while being bandwidth-friendly.

In a [previous article][], I have described a solution to self-host
videos while offering a delivery adapted to each user's bandwidth,
thanks to HLS and [hls.js][]. Subtitles[^captions] were not part of
the game. While they can be declared inside the HLS manifest or
embedded into the video, it is easier to include them directly in the
`<video>` element, using the [WebVTT format][]:

    ::html hl_lines="7 8 9 10"
    <video poster="poster.jpg"
           controls preload="none">
      <source src="index.m3u8"
              type="application/vnd.apple.mpegurl">
      <source src="progressive.mp4"
              type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.4d401f, mp4a.40.2"'>
      <track src="de.vtt"
             kind="subtitles" srclang="de" label="Deutsch">
      <track src="en.vtt"
             kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">
    </video>

[^captions]: Some people may be picky over [the difference between
    closed captions and subtitles][]. *Closed captions* are usually
    targeted at people with hearing impairment and they include
    non-speech information like sound effects. *Subtitles* assume the
    viewer can hear but may not understand the language.

Watch the following demonstration, featuring [Agent 327: Operation
Barbershop][], a video created by [Blender Animation Studio][] and
currently released under the [Creative Commons Attribution No
Derivatives 2.0][] license:

![]([[!!videos/2019-self-hosted-videos-subtitles.m3u8]])

You may want to jump to [0:12](#video-seek-12) for the first subtitle.
Most browsers should display a widget to toggle subtitles. <del>This works
just fine with *Chromium* but *Firefox* will [not show the menu until
the video starts playing][], unless you enable preloading.</del> Another
annoyance: there is no simple way to specify safe margins for
subtitles and they get stuck at the bottom. These two issues seem
minor enough to not warrant pulling hundred of kilobytes of JavaScript
for a custom player.

!!! "Update (2019-12)" If subtitles are served from another domain,
`crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute needs to be added to the `<video>`
tag and subtitles need to handle [CORS headers][]. On some browsers, this
also enables CORS for the video and the poster.

!!! "Update (2020-09)" The issue with *Firefox* and the subtitle menu
is fixed in [Firefox 76][]. On Android, subtitles work from Firefox 80.
