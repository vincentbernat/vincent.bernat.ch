Here are the slides of an internal presentation at [Dailymotion][].
This is an introduction to [SystemTap][] and our usage of it. It was
quite instrumental to improve the performance of the website by
finding various bottlenecks in production. I did publish a
[cookbook][] containing various scripts, including the distribution of
response times for PHP requests with the top offenders, and the
distribution of client cookie sizes. The cookbook is compiling Jinja
templates to build SystemTap scripts. I never blogged about it but, at
the time, this was quite innovative.
