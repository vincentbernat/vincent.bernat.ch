 solved with a custom Ansible module.

Ansible ships a lot of modules you can combine for your configuration
management needs. However, the quality of these modules may vary
widely. Sometimes, it may be quicker and more robust to write your own
module instead of shopping and assembling existing
ones.[^dependencies]

[^dependencies]: Also, when using modules from [Ansible Galaxy][], you
    introduce a dependency to a third-party. This is not something
    that should be decided lightly: it may break later, it may only
    meet 80% of the needs, it may add bugs.

In my opinion, a robust module exhibits the following characteristics:

- idempotency,
- diff support,
- check mode compatibility,
- correct change signaling, and
- lifecycle management.

In a nutshell, it means the module can run with `--diff --check` and
shows the changes it would apply. When run twice in a row, the second
run won't apply or signal changes. The last bullet point suggests the
module should be able to delete outdated objects configured during
previous runs.[^terraform]

[^terraform]: Some declarative systems, like [Terraform][], exhibits
all these behaviors.

The module code should be minimal and tailored to *your* needs. Making
the module generic for use by other users is a non-goal. Less code
usually means less bugs and easier to understand.

I do not cover testing here. It is undeniably a good practice, but it
requires a significant effort. In my opinion, it is preferable to have
a well written module matching the above characteristics rather than a
module that is well tested but without them or a module requiring
further (untested) assembly to meet your needs.

# Module skeleton

Ansible documentation contains [instructions to build a module][],
along with some [best practices][]. As one of our non-goal is to
distribute it, we choose to take some shortcuts and skip some of the
boilerplate. Let's assume we build a module with the following
signature:

    ::yaml
    custom_module:
      user: someone
      password: something
      data: "some random string"

There are various locations you can put a module in Ansible. A common
possibility is to include it into a role. In a `library/`
subdirectory, create an empty `__init__.py` file and a
`custom_module.py` file with the [following code][]:[^shebang]

    ::python
    #!/usr/bin/python
    
    import yaml
    from ansible.module_utils.basic import AnsibleModule
    
    
    def main():
        # Define options accepted by the module. ❶
        module_args = dict(
            user=dict(type='str', required=True),
            password=dict(type='str', required=True, no_log=True),
            data=dict(type='str', required=True),
        )
    
        module = AnsibleModule(
            argument_spec=module_args,
            supports_check_mode=True
        )
        
        result = dict(
            changed=False
        )
    
        got = {}
        wanted = {}
    
        # Populate both `got` and `wanted`. ❷
        # [...]
    
        if got != wanted:
            result['changed'] = True
            result['diff'] = dict(
                before=yaml.safe_dump(got),
                after=yaml.safe_dump(wanted)
            )
    
        if module.check_mode or not result['changed']:
            module.exit_json(**result)
    
        # Apply changes. ❸
        # [...]
    
        module.exit_json(**result)
    
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

[^shebang]: Do not worry about the shebang. It is hardcoded to
    `/usr/bin/python`. Ansible will modify it to match the chosen
    interpreter on the remote host. You can write Python 3 code if
    `ansible_python_interpreter` evaluates to a Python 3 interpreter.

The first part, in ❶, defines the module, with the **accepted
options**. Refer to the [documentation on
`argument_spec`][argument_spec] for more details.

The second part, in ❷, builds the `got` and `wanted` variables. `got`
is the **current state** while `wanted` is the **target state**. For
example, if you need to modify records in a database server, `got`
would be the current rows while `wanted` would be the modified rows.
Then, we compare `got` and `wanted`. If there is a difference,
`changed` is switched to `True` and we prepare the `diff` object.
Ansible uses it to display the differences between the states. If we
are running in check mode or if no change is detected, we stop here.

The last part, in ❸, **applies the changes**. Usually, it means
iterating over the two structures to detect the differences and create
the missing items, delete the unwanted ones and update the existing
ones.

## Documentation

Ansible provides a fairly complete page on [how to document a
module][]. I advise you to take a more minimal approach by only
documenting each option sparingly,[^repetition] skipping the examples
and only documenting return values if it needs to. I usually limit
myself to something like this:

    ::python
    DOCUMENTATION = """
    ---
    module: custom_module.py
    short_description: Pass provided data to remote service
    description:
      - Mention anything useful for your workmate.
      - Also mention anything you want to remember in 6 months.
    options:
      user:
        description:
          - user to identify to remote service
      password:
        description:
          - password for authentication to remote service
      data:
        description:
          - data to send to remote service
    """

[^repetition]: The main issue I have with this non-programmatic
    approach to documentation is that it partly repeats the
    information contained in `argument_spec`. I think an
    auto-documenting structure would avoid this.

## Error handling

If you run into an error, you can stop the execution with
`module.fail_json()`:

    ::python
    module.fail_json(
        msg=f"remote service answered with {code}: {message}",
        **result
    )

There is no requirement to intercept all errors. Sometimes, not
swallowing an exception provides better information than replacing it
with a generic message.

## Returning additional values

A module may return additional information that can be captured to be
used in another task through the [`register` directive][register].
For this purpose, you can add arbitrary fields to the `result`
dictionary. Have a look at the documentation for [common return
values][]. You should try to add these fields before exiting the
module when in check mode. The returned values can be [documented][how
to document a module].

# Examples

Here are several examples of custom modules following the previous
skeleton. Each example highlight why a custom module was written
instead of assembling existing modules. ⚙️

 - [Syncing MySQL tables][]
 - [Syncing NetBox][]
 - [Syncing RIPE, ARIN and APNIC objects][]
 - Syncing GCP IPsec VPNs (not done yet)
