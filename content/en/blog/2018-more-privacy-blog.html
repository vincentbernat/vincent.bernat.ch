title: "A more privacy-friendly blog"
description: |
  Over the years, I have implemented some changes to this blog
  to make it more privacy-friendly.

When I [started this blog][new-site], I embraced some free services, like
[Disqus][] or [Google Analytics][]. These services are quite invasive
for users' privacy. Over the years, I have tried to correct this to
reach a point where I do not rely on any "privacy-hostile" services.

[TOC]

# Analytics

 - **Before**: [Google Analytics][]
 - **After**: nothing

*Google Analytics* is an ubiquitous solution to get a powerful
analytics solution for free. It's also a great way to provide data
about your visitors to Google‚Äîalso for free. There are self-hosted
solutions like [Matomo][]‚Äîpreviously *Piwik*.

I opted for a simpler solution: no analytics. It also enables me to
think that my blog attracts thousands of visitors every day.

# Fonts

 - **Before**: [Google Fonts][]
 - **After**: self-hosted

*Google Fonts* is a very popular font library and hosting service,
which relies on the generic [Google Privacy Policy][]. The
[google-webfonts-helper][] service makes it easy to self-host any font
from *Google Fonts*. Moreover, with help from
[`pyftsubset`][pyftsubset], I include only the characters used in this
blog. The font files are lighter *and* more complete: no problem
spelling "Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k".

# Videos

 - **Before**: [YouTube][]
 - **After**: self-hosted

Some articles are supported by a video (like "[OPL2LPT: an AdLib sound
card for the parallel port][]"). In the past, I was using [YouTube][],
mostly because it was the only free platform with an option to disable
ads. Streaming on-demand videos is usually deemed quite difficult. For
example, if you just use the `<video>` tag, you may push a too big
video for people with a slow connection. However, it is not that hard,
thanks to [hls.js][], which enables to deliver video sliced in
segments available at different bitrates. Users with Java¬≠Script
disabled are still delivered with a progressive version of medium
quality.

In ‚Äú[Self-hosted videos with HLS][]‚Äù, I explain this approach in more
details.

# Comments

 - **Before**: [Disqus][]
 - **After**: self-hosted, with [Isso][]

*Disqus* is a popular comment solution for static websites. They were
recently acquired by *Zeta Global*, a marketing company and their
business model is supported only by advertisements. On the technical
side, *Disqus* also [loads several hundred kilobytes of
resources][]. Therefore, many websites load *Disqus* on demand. That's
what I did. This doesn't solve the privacy problem and I had the
sentiment people were less eager to leave a comment if they had to
execute an additional action.

For some time, I thought about implementing my own comment system
around Atom feeds. Each page would get its own feed of comments. A
piece of Java¬≠Script would turn these feeds into HTML and comments
could still be read without Java¬≠Script, thanks to the default
rendering provided by browsers. People could also subscribe to these
feeds: no need for mail notifications! The feeds would be served as
static files and updated on new comments by a small piece of
server-side code. Again, this could work without Javascript.

![Day Planner by Fowl Language Comics]([[!!images/day-planner@2x.jpg]] "<a href='https://www.fowllanguagecomics.com/comic/day-planner/'>Fowl Language Comics: Day Planner</a> or the real reason why I didn't code a new comment system.")

I still think this is a great idea. But I didn't feel like developing
and maintaining a new comment system. There are several self-hosted
alternatives, notably [Isso][] and [Commento][]. *Isso* is a bit more
featureful, with notably an imperfect import from *Disqus*. Both are
struggling with maintenance and are trying to become sustainable with
a paid hosted version.[^hosted] *Commento* is more privacy-friendly as it doesn't
use cookies at all. However, cookies from *Isso* are not essential and
can be filtered with *nginx*:

    ::text
    proxy_hide_header Set-Cookie;
    proxy_hide_header X-Set-Cookie;
    proxy_ignore_headers Set-Cookie;

[^hosted]: For *Isso*, look at [comment.sh][]. For *Commento*, look at
    [commento.io][].

In *Isso*, there is currently [no mail notifications][pr50], but I
have added an [Atom feed for each comment thread][pr419].

Another option would have been to not provide comments
anymore. However, I had some great contributions as comments in the
past and I also think they can work as some kind of peer review for
blog articles: they are a weak guarantee that the content is not
totally wrong.

# Search engine

 - **Before**: [Google Search][]
 - **After**: [DuckDuckGo][]

A way to provide a search engine for a personal blog is to provide a
form for a public search engine, like Google. That's what I did. I
also slapped some Java¬≠Script on top of that to make it look like not
Google.

The solution here is easy: switch to [DuckDuckGo][], which lets you
[customize][] a bit the search experience:

    ::html
    <form id="lf-search" action="https://duckduckgo.com/">
      <input type="hidden" name="kf" value="-1">
      <input type="hidden" name="kaf" value="1">
      <input type="hidden" name="k1" value="-1">
      <input type="hidden" name="sites" value="vincent.bernat.im/{{ resource.meta.language }}">
      <input type="submit" value="">
      <input type="text" name="q" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Search">
    </form>

The Java¬≠Script part is also removed as *DuckDuckGo* doesn't provide
an API. As it is unlikely that more than three people will use the
search engine in a year, this seems a good idea to not spend too much
time on this non-essential feature.

# Newsletter

 - **Before**: RSS feed
 - **After**: still RSS feed but also a [MailChimp][] newsletter

Nowadays, RSS feeds are far less popular they were before. I am still
baffled as why a technical audience wouldn't use RSS, but some readers
prefer to receive updates by mail.

[MailChimp][] is a common solution to send newsletters. It provides a
simple integration with RSS feeds to trigger a mail each time new
items are added to the feed. From a privacy point of view, *MailChimp*
seems a good citizen: data collection is mainly limited to the amount
needed to operate the service. Privacy-conscious users can still avoid
this service and use the [RSS feed][rss].

# Less Java¬≠Script

 - **Before**: third-party Java¬≠Script code
 - **After**: self-hosted Java¬≠Script code

Many privacy-conscious people are disabling Java¬≠Script or using
extensions like [uMatrix][] or [NoScript][]. Except for comments, I
was using Java¬≠Script only for non-essential stuff:

 - rendering mathematical content (like in ‚Äú[TLS computational DoS mitigation][]‚Äù),
 - moving footnotes as sidenotes when the screen is large enough,[^footnote]
 - enhancing videos to use *HLS* (see "[Self-hosted videos with HLS][]‚Äù), and
 - enhancing photo galleries with a *lightbox* (see "[Debian on Thinkpad Edge 11][]‚Äù).

[^footnote]: You may have noticed I am a footnote sicko and use them
    all the time for pointless stuff.

For mathematical formulae, I have switched from [MathJax][] to
[KaTeX][]. The later is faster but also enables server-side rendering:
it produces the same output regardless of browser. Therefore,
client-side Java¬≠Script is not needed anymore.

For sidenotes, I have turned the Java¬≠Script code doing the
transformation into Python code, with [pyquery][]. No more client-side
Java¬≠Script for this aspect either.

The remaining code is still here but is self-hosted.

# Memento: CSP

The HTTP `Content-Security-Policy` header controls the resources that
a user agent is allowed to load for a given page. It is a safeguard
and a memento for the external resources a site will use. Mine is
moderately complex and shows what to expect from a privacy point of
view:[^cdn]

    ::text
    Content-Security-Policy:
      default-src 'self' blob:;
      script-src  'self' blob: https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/js/;
      object-src  'self' https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/;
      img-src     'self' data: https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/;
      frame-src   https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/;
      style-src   'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/css/;
      font-src    'self' about: data: https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/fonts/;
      worker-src  blob:;
      media-src   'self' blob: https://luffy-video.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io;
      connect-src 'self' https://luffy-video.sos-ch-dk-2.exo.io https://comments.luffy.cx;
      frame-ancestors 'none';
      block-all-mixed-content;

[^cdn]: I don't have issue with using a CDN like [CloudFront][]: it is
    a paid service and Amazon AWS is not in the business of tracking
    users.

I am quite happy having been able to reach this result. üòä
