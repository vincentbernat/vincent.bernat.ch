  Over the years, I have implemented some changes to this blog
  to make it more privacy-friendly.

When I [started this blog][new-site], I embraced some free services, like
[Disqus][] or [Google Analytics][]. These services are quite invasive
to users' privacy. Over the years, I have tried to correct this to
reach a point where I do not rely on any "privacy-hostile" services.

[TOC]

# Analytics

 - **Before**: [Google Analytics][]
 - **After**: nothing

*Google Analytics* is a ubiquitous solution to get a powerful
analytics solution for free. It's also a great way to provide data
about your visitors to Googleâ€”also for free. There are self-hosted
solutions like [Matomo][], [GoatCounter][], or [Plausible][].

I opted for a simpler solution: no analytics. It also enables me to
think that my blog attracts thousands of visitors every day.

!!! "Update (2019-02)" As for server-side logs, IP addresses are
anonymized using [ipscrub][], a module for *nginx*. However, non-HTML
assets are served through *Amazon CloudFront*.[^cdn]

[^cdn]: I don't have an issue with using a CDN like [CloudFront][]: it
    is a paid service and Amazon is not in the business of tracking
    users.

# Fonts

 - **Before**: [Google Fonts][]
 - **After**: self-hosted

*Google Fonts* is a very popular font library and hosting service,
which relies on the generic [Google Privacy Policy][]. The
[google-webfonts-helper][] service makes it easy to self-host any font
from *Google Fonts*. Moreover, with help from
[`pyftsubset`][pyftsubset], I only include the characters used in this
blog. The font files are lighter *and* more complete: no problem
spelling "AntonÃ­n DvoÅ™Ã¡k."

# Videos

 - **Before**: [YouTube][]
 - **After**: self-hosted

Some articles are supported by a videoâ€”like "[OPL2LPT: an AdLib sound
card for the parallel port][]." In the past, I was using [YouTube][],
mostly because it was the only free platform with an option to disable
ads. Streaming on-demand videos is usually deemed quite difficult. For
example, if you just use the `<video>` tag, you may push a too big
video for people with a slow connection. However, it is not that hard:
[hls.js][] enables us to deliver video sliced in segments available at
different bitrates. Users with JavaÂ­Script disabled are still
delivered with a progressive version of medium quality.

In "[Self-hosted videos with HLS][]," I explain this approach in more
detail.

# Comments

 - **Before**: [Disqus][]
 - **After**: self-hosted, with [Isso][]

*Disqus* is a popular comment solution for static websites. They were
recently acquired by *Zeta Global*, a marketing company, and their
business model is supported only by ads. On the technical
side, *Disqus* also [loads several hundred kilobytes of
resources][]. Therefore, many websites load *Disqus* on demand. That's
what I did. This doesn't solve the privacy problem and I had the
sentiment people were less eager to leave a comment if they had to
execute an additional action.

!!! "Update (2019-01)" A year later, I can confirm the number of
comments has significantly increased after removing this additional
step. Between 2011 and 2015, the site harvested about 140 comments. In
2016, *Disqus* was no longer loaded automatically and the number of
comments was halved. In 2018, after switching to *Isso* and
automatic loading, there were 158 comments.

For some time, I thought about implementing my own comment system
around Atom feeds. Each page would get its feed of comments. A piece
of JavaÂ­Script would turn these feeds into HTML and comments could
still be read without JavaÂ­Script, thanks to the default rendering
provided by browsers. People could also subscribe to these feeds: no
need for mail notifications! The feeds would be served as static files
and updated on new comments by a small piece of server-side code.
Again, this could work without JavaScript.

![Day Planner by Fowl Language Comics]([[!!images/day-planner@2x.jpg]] "<a href='https://www.fowllanguagecomics.com/comic/day-planner/'>Fowl Language Comics: Day Planner</a> or the real reason why I didn't code a new comment system.")

I still think this is a great idea. But I didn't feel like developing
and maintaining a new comment system. There are several self-hosted
alternatives, notably [Isso][] and [Commento][]. *Isso* is a bit more
featureful, with notably an imperfect import from *Disqus*. Both are
struggling with maintenance and are trying to become sustainable with
a paid hosted version.[^hosted] *Commento* is more privacy-friendly as it doesn't
use cookies at all. However, cookies from *Isso* are not essential and
can be filtered with *nginx*:

    proxy_hide_header Set-Cookie;
    proxy_hide_header X-Set-Cookie;
    proxy_ignore_headers Set-Cookie;

[^hosted]: <del>For *Isso*, look at [comment.sh][].</del> For
    *Commento*, look at [commento.io][].

<del>In *Isso*, there is currently [no mail notifications][pr50], but I
have added an [Atom feed for each comment thread][pr419].</del>

!!! "Update (2019-01)" Mail notifications were recently added and I
have just enabled them here. As absolutely nobody ever used the Atom
feeds, I have removed them.

Another option would have been to not provide comments anymore.
However, I have some great contributions as comments and I also think
they can work as some kind of peer review for blog articles: they are
a weak guarantee that the content is not wrong.

# Search engine

 - **Before**: [Google Search][]
 - **After**: [DuckDuckGo][]

A way to provide a search engine for a personal blog is to provide a
form for a public search engine, like Google. That's what I did. I
also slapped some JavaÂ­Script on top of that to make it look like not
Google.

The solution here is easy: switch to [DuckDuckGo][], which lets you
[customize][] a bit the search experience:

    ::html
    <form id="lf-search" action="https://duckduckgo.com/">
      <input type="hidden" name="kf" value="-1">
      <input type="hidden" name="kaf" value="1">
      <input type="hidden" name="k1" value="-1">
      <input type="hidden" name="sites" value="vincent.bernat.ch/{{ resource.meta.language }}">
      <input type="submit" value="">
      <input type="text" name="q" value="" autocomplete="off" aria-label="Search">
    </form>

The JavaÂ­Script part is also removed as *DuckDuckGo* doesn't provide
an API. As it is unlikely that more than three people will use the
search engine in a year, this seems a good idea to not spend too much
time on this non-essential feature.

# Newsletter

 - **Before**: RSS feed
 - **After**: RSS feed <del>but also a [MailChimp][] newsletter</del>

Nowadays, RSS feeds are far less popular they were before. I am still
baffled as to why a technical audience wouldn't use RSS, but some
readers prefer to receive updates by mail.

[MailChimp][] is a common solution to send newsletters. It provides a
simple integration with RSS feeds to trigger a mail each time new
items are added to the feed. From a privacy point of view, *MailChimp*
seems a good citizen: data collection is mainly limited to the amount
needed to operate the service. Privacy-conscious users can still avoid
this service and use the [RSS feed][rss].

!!! "Update (2019-12)" I have removed the newsletter. There were not
many subscribers (around 40) and I felt bad about advertising such a
service. Instead, I have added links to RSS-to-email services.

# Less JavaÂ­Script

 - **Before**: third-party JavaÂ­Script code
 - **After**: self-hosted JavaÂ­Script code

Many privacy-conscious people are disabling JavaÂ­Script or using
extensions like [uMatrix][] or [NoScript][]. Except for comments, I
was using JavaÂ­Script only for non-essential stuff:

 - rendering mathematical contentâ€”like in "[TLS computational DoS mitigation][];"
 - moving footnotes as sidenotes when the screen is large enough;[^footnote]
 - enhancing videos to use *HLS*â€”see "[Self-hosted videos with HLS][];" and
 - enhancing photo galleries with a *lightbox*â€”see "[Debian on ThinkPad Edge 11][]."

[^footnote]: You may have noticed I am a footnote sicko and use them
    all the time for pointless stuff.

For mathematical formulae, I have switched from [MathJax][] to
[KaTeX][]. The latter is faster and enables server-side rendering:
it produces the same output regardless of the browser. Therefore,
the client-side JavaÂ­Script is not needed anymore.

For sidenotes, I have turned the JavaÂ­Script code doing the
transformation into Python code, with [pyquery][]. No more client-side
JavaÂ­Script for this aspect either.

The remaining code is still here but is self-hosted.

# Memento: CSP

The HTTP `Content-Security-Policy` header controls the resources that
a user agent is allowed to load for a given page. It is a safeguard
and a memento for the external resources a site will use. Mine is
moderately complex and shows what to expect from a privacy point of
view:

    Content-Security-Policy:
      {% from "nginx.j2" import csp with context %}{{ csp()|indent(6) }}

I am quite happy having been able to reach this result. ðŸ˜Š
