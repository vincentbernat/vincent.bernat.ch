Internet is split into five [regional Internet registry][]: AFRINIC,
ARIN, APNIC, LACNIC, and RIPE. Each RIR maintains an [Internet Routing
Registry][]. An IRR allows one to publish **information about the
routing of Internet number resources**.[^others] Operators use this to
determine the owner of an IP address and to construct and maintain
**routing filters**. To ensure your routes are widely accepted, it is
important to keep the prefixes you announce up-to-date in an IRR.

[^others]: Other IRRs exist without being attached to an RIR. The most
    notable one is [RADb][].

There are two common tools to query this database: `whois` and
`bgpq4`. The first one allows you to do a query with the [WHOIS
protocol][]:

    ::console
    $ whois -BrG 2a0a:e805:400::/40
    […]
    inet6num:       2a0a:e805:400::/40
    netname:        FR-BLADE-CUSTOMERS-DE
    country:        DE
    geoloc:         50.1109 8.6821
    admin-c:        BN2763-RIPE
    tech-c:         BN2763-RIPE
    status:         ASSIGNED
    mnt-by:         fr-blade-1-mnt
    remarks:        synced with cmdb

    source:         RIPE
    
    route6:         2a0a:e805:400::/40
    descr:          Blade IPv6 - AMS1
    origin:         AS64476
    mnt-by:         fr-blade-1-mnt

    last-modified:  2020-05-19T08:05:00Z
    source:         RIPE

The second one allows you to build route filters using the information
contained in the IRR database:

    ::console
    $ bgpq4 -6 -S RIPE -b AS64476
    NN = [
        2a0a:e805::/40,
        2a0a:e805:100::/40,
        2a0a:e805:300::/40,
        2a0a:e805:400::/40,
        2a0a:e805:500::/40
    ];

There is no module available on [Ansible Galaxy][] to manage these
objects. Each IRR has different ways of being updated. Some RIRs
propose an API but some don't. If we restrict ourselves to RIPE, ARIN,
and APNIC, the only common method to update objects is [email
updates][], authenticated with a password or a GPG signature.[^arin]
Let's write a custom Ansible module for this purpose!

[^arin]: ARIN is phasing out this method in favor of [IRR-online][].
    RIPE has an [API][REST API] available, but email updates are still
    supported and not planned to be deprecated. APNIC plans to expose
    an [API][APNIC API].

!!! "Notice" I recommend that you read "[Writing a custom Ansible
module][]" as an introduction, as well as "[Syncing MySQL tables][]"
for a more instructive example.

# Code

The [module][] takes a list of RPSL objects to synchronize and returns
the body of an email update if a change is needed:

    ::yaml
    - name: prepare RIPE objects
      irr_sync:
        irr: RIPE
        mntner: fr-blade-1-mnt
        source: whois-ripe.txt
      register: irr

## Prerequisites

The source file should be a set of objects to sync using the [RPSL
language][]. This would be the same content you would send manually by
email. All objects should be managed by the same maintainer, which is
also provided as a parameter.

Signing and sending the result is not the responsibility of this
module. You need two additional tasks for this purpose:

    ::yaml hl_lines="4 5 18"
    - name: sign RIPE objects
      shell:
        cmd: gpg --batch --user noc@example.com --clearsign
        stdin: "{% raw %}{{ irr.objects }}{% endraw %}"
      register: signed
      check_mode: false
      changed_when: false
    
    - name: update RIPE objects by email
      mail:
        subject: "NEW: update for RIPE"
        from: noc@example.com
        to: "auto-dbm@ripe.net"
        cc: noc@example.com
        host: smtp.example.com
        port: 25
        charset: us-ascii
        body: "{% raw %}{{ signed.stdout }}{% endraw %}"

You also need to authorize the PGP keys used to sign the updates by
creating a `key-cert` object and adding it as a valid authentication
method for the corresponding `mntner` object:

    ::yaml
    key-cert:  PGPKEY-A791AAAB
    certif:    -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
    certif:    
    certif:    mQGNBF8TLY8BDADEwP3a6/vRhEERBIaPUAFnr23zKCNt5YhWRZyt50mKq1RmQBBY
    […]
    certif:    -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
    mnt-by:    fr-blade-1-mnt
    source:    RIPE
    
    mntner:    fr-blade-1-mnt
    […]
    auth:      PGPKEY-A791AAAB
    mnt-by:    fr-blade-1-mnt
    source:    RIPE

## Module definition

Starting from the skeleton described in the [previous article][Writing
a custom Ansible module], we define the module:

    ::python
    module_args = dict(
        irr=dict(type='str', required=True),
        mntner=dict(type='str', required=True),
        source=dict(type='path', required=True),
    )

    result = dict(
        changed=False,
    )

    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=module_args,
        supports_check_mode=True
    )

## Getting existing objects

To grab existing objects, we use the `whois` command to retrieve all
the objects from the provided maintainer.

    ::python
    # Per-IRR variations:
    # - whois server
    whois = {
        'ARIN': 'rr.arin.net',
        'RIPE': 'whois.ripe.net',
        'APNIC': 'whois.apnic.net'
    }
    # - whois options
    options = {
        'ARIN': ['-r'],
        'RIPE': ['-BrG'],
        'APNIC': ['-BrG']
    }
    # - objects excluded from synchronization
    excluded = ["domain"]
    if irr == "ARIN":
        # ARIN does not return these objects
        excluded.extend([
            "key-cert",
            "mntner",
        ])

    # Grab existing objects
    args = ["-h", whois[irr],
            "-s", irr,
            *options[irr],
            "-i", "mnt-by",
            module.params['mntner']]
    proc = subprocess.run("whois", *args, capture_output=True)
    if proc.returncode != 0:
        raise AnsibleError(
            f"unable to query whois: {args}")
    output = proc.stdout.decode('ascii')
    got = extract(output, excluded)

The first part of the code setup some IRR-specific constants: the
server to query, the options to provide to the `whois` command and the
objects to exclude from synchronization. The second part invokes the
`whois` command, requesting all objects whose `mnt-by` field is the
provided maintainer. Here is an example of output:

    ::console
    $ whois -h whois.ripe.net -s RIPE -BrG -i mnt-by fr-blade-1-mnt
    […]
    
    inet6num:       2a0a:e805:300::/40
    netname:        FR-BLADE-CUSTOMERS-FR
    country:        FR
    geoloc:         48.8566 2.3522
    admin-c:        BN2763-RIPE
    tech-c:         BN2763-RIPE
    status:         ASSIGNED
    mnt-by:         fr-blade-1-mnt
    remarks:        synced with cmdb
    created:        2020-05-19T08:04:59Z
    last-modified:  2020-05-19T08:04:59Z
    source:         RIPE
    
    […]
    
    route6:         2a0a:e805:300::/40
    descr:          Blade IPv6 - PA1
    origin:         AS64476
    mnt-by:         fr-blade-1-mnt
    remarks:        synced with cmdb

    source:         RIPE
    
    […]

The result is passed to the `extract()` function. It parses and
normalizes the results into a dictionary mapping object names to
objects. We store the result in the `got` variable.

    ::python
    def extract(raw, excluded):
        """Extract objects."""
        # First step, remove comments and unwanted lines
        objects = "\n".join([obj
                             for obj in raw.split("\n")
                             if not obj.startswith((
                                     "#",
                                     "%",
                             ))])
        # Second step, split objects
        objects = [RPSLObject(obj.strip())
                   for obj in re.split(r"\n\n+", objects)
                   if obj.strip()
                   and not obj.startswith(
                       tuple(f"{x}:" for x in excluded))]
        # Last step, put objects in a dict
        objects = {repr(obj): obj
                   for obj in objects}
        return objects

`RPSLObject()` is a class enabling normalization and comparison of
objects. Look at the [module code][module] for more details.

    ::pycon
    >>> output="""
    ... inet6num:       2a0a:e805:300::/40
    ... […]
    ... """
    >>> pprint({k: str(v) for k,v in extract(output, excluded=[])})
    {'<Object:inet6num:2a0a:e805:300::/40>':
       'inet6num:       2a0a:e805:300::/40\n'
       'netname:        FR-BLADE-CUSTOMERS-FR\n'
       'country:        FR\n'
       'geoloc:         48.8566 2.3522\n'
       'admin-c:        BN2763-RIPE\n'
       'tech-c:         BN2763-RIPE\n'
       'status:         ASSIGNED\n'
       'mnt-by:         fr-blade-1-mnt\n'
       'remarks:        synced with cmdb\n'
       'source:         RIPE',
     '<Object:route6:2a0a:e805:300::/40>':
       'route6:         2a0a:e805:300::/40\n'
       'descr:          Blade IPv6 - PA1\n'
       'origin:         AS64476\n'
       'mnt-by:         fr-blade-1-mnt\n'
       'remarks:        synced with cmdb\n'
       'source:         RIPE'}

## Comparing with wanted objects

Let's build the `wanted` dictionary using the same structure, thanks
to the `extract()` function we can use verbatim:

    ::python
    with open(module.params['source']) as f:
        source = f.read()
    wanted = extract(source, excluded)

The next step is to compare `got` and `wanted` to build the diff
object:

    ::python
    if got != wanted:
        result['changed'] = True
        if module._diff:
            result['diff'] = [
                dict(before_header=k,
                     after_header=k,
                     before=str(got.get(k, "")),
                     after=str(wanted.get(k, "")))
                for k in set((*wanted.keys(), *got.keys()))
                if k not in wanted or k not in got or wanted[k] != got[k]]

## Returning updates

The module does not have a side effect. If there is a difference, we
return the updates to send by email. We choose to include all wanted
objects in the updates (contained in the `source` variable) and let
the IRR ignore unmodified objects. We also append the objects to be
deleted by adding a `delete:` attribute to each of them.

    ::python
    # We send all source objects and deleted objects.
    deleted_mark = f"{'delete:':16}deleted by CMDB"
    deleted = "\n\n".join([f"{got[k].raw}\n{deleted_mark}"
                           for k in got
                           if k not in wanted])
    result['objects'] = f"{source}\n\n{deleted}"
    
    module.exit_json(**result)

---

The complete code is available on [GitHub][module]. The module
supports both `--diff` and `--check` flags. It does not return
anything if no change is detected. It can work with APNIC, RIPE, and
ARIN. It is not perfect: it may not detect some changes,[^changes] it
is not able to modify objects not owned by the provided
maintainer[^mntner] and some attributes cannot be modified, requiring
to manually delete and recreate the updated object.[^modify] However,
this module should automate 95% of your needs.

[^changes]: For ARIN, we cannot query `key-cert` and `mntner` objects
    and therefore we cannot detect changes in them. It is also not
    possible to detect changes to the auth mechanisms of a `mntner`
    object.

[^mntner]: APNIC does not assign top-level objects to the maintainer
    associated with the owner.

[^modify]: Changing the status of an `inetnum` object requires
    deleting and recreating the object.
