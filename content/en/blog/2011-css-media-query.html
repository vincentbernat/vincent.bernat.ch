Nowadays, many websites provide a mobile version, like
[Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org), which usually is a version
tailored to device with less bandwidth and smaller
screen. [CSS Media Queries][w3c] is a candidate recommendation from
the W3C to support different stylesheets depending on the how the
document is displayed. This allows you to build a mobile version just by
providing additional instructions in your CSS style sheet.

# Using CSS Media Queries

There are two ways to use CSS media queries. You can provide an
additional CSS stylesheet and let the browser knows when to use it:

    ::html
    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 700px)" href="mobile.css">

When the width of the viewport is less than 700 pixels, the stylesheet
`mobile.css` will be used. Another way to use CSS media queries is to
declare a section inside your current CSS style sheet:

    ::css
    @media screen and (max-width: 700px) {
        #article {
           margin: 0.3em 0.2em;
        }
    }

While there are many available properties, the most two common ones
will be `max-width` and `min-width`. You can use this feature to
modify some aspects of your web site like reducing margins or hiding
some extra navigational blocks.

# Browser support

Current versions of mobile browsers
[support CSS media queries][browser]: Safari Mobile, Android browser
and Opera mobile will handle it without a glitch. If you use CSS media
queries to provide a mobile version of your web site, you don't really
have to worry about browser compatibility.

There exists [polyfills][polyfill] that will enable this feature on
unsupported browsers like Internet Explorer 8. One of them is
[Respond][respond] which is a lightweight polyfill targeted at
supporting only `min-width` and `max-width` in Internet Explorer 6, 7 and
8.

# Example

I have added CSS media queries to my website. Try it by resizing the
window of your browser. Here are some of the changes depending on the
width of the window:

 - the sidebar transforms into a topbar
 - the search box is hidden
 - padding is reduced at various places

Here is the current look in a classic browser:

![Website look on a classic browser][s1]
[s1]: [[!!images/css-media-query-large.jpg]] "Desktop view"

If you reduce the size of your window, you will get something like this:

![Website look on a narrow window][s2]
[s2]: [[!!images/css-media-query-small.jpg]] "Mobile view"
