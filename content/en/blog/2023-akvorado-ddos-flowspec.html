[Akvorado][] collects [sFlow][] and [IPFIX][] flows, stores them in a
[ClickHouse][] database, and presents them in a web console. Although it lacks
built-in DDoS detection, it's possible to create one by crafting custom
_ClickHouse_ queries.

# DDoS detection

Let's assume we want to detect DDoS targeting our customers. As an example, we
consider a DDoS attack as a collection of flows over **one minute** targeting a
**single customer IP address**, from a **single source port** and matching one
of these conditions:

- an average bandwidth of 1 Gbps,
- an average bandwidth of 200 Mbps when the protocol is UDP,
- more than 20 source IP addresses and an average bandwidth of 100 Mbps, or
- more than 10 source countries and an average bandwidth of 100 Mbps.

Here is the SQL query to detect such attacks over the last 5 minutes:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT
    toStartOfMinute(TimeReceived) AS TimeReceived,
    DstAddr,
    SrcPort,
    dictGetOrDefault('protocols', 'name', Proto, '???') AS Proto,
    SUM(((((Bytes * SamplingRate) * 8) / 1000) / 1000) / 1000) / 60 AS Gbps,
    uniq(SrcAddr) AS sources,
    uniq(SrcCountry) AS countries
  FROM flows
  WHERE TimeReceived > now() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE
    AND DstNetRole = 'customers'
  GROUP BY
    TimeReceived,
    DstAddr,
    SrcPort,
    Proto
)
WHERE (Gbps > 1)
   OR ((Proto = 'UDP') AND (Gbps > 0.2)) 
   OR ((sources > 20) AND (Gbps > 0.1)) 
   OR ((countries > 10) AND (Gbps > 0.1))
ORDER BY
  TimeReceived DESC,
  Gbps DESC
```

Here is an example output[^format] where two of our users are under attack. One
from what looks like an [NTP amplification attack][], the other from a [DNS
amplification attack][]:

|        TimeReceived | DstAddr                | SrcPort | Proto |  Gbps | sources | countries |
|--------------------:|:-----------------------|--------:|:------|------:|--------:|----------:|

| 2023-02-26 17:43:00 | `::ffff:203.0.113.206` |     123 | UDP   | 0.130 |     133 |        17 |
| 2023-02-26 17:43:00 | `::ffff:203.0.113.68`  |      53 | UDP   | 0.129 |     364 |        63 |
| 2023-02-26 17:43:00 | `::ffff:203.0.113.206` |     123 | UDP   | 0.113 |     129 |        21 |
| 2023-02-26 17:42:00 | `::ffff:203.0.113.206` |     123 | UDP   | 0.139 |      50 |        14 |
| 2023-02-26 17:42:00 | `::ffff:203.0.113.206` |     123 | UDP   | 0.105 |      42 |        14 |
| 2023-02-26 17:40:00 | `::ffff:203.0.113.68`  |      53 | UDP   | 0.121 |     340 |        65 |

[^format]: *ClickHouse* can export results using *Markdown* format when
    appending `FORMAT Markdown` to the query.

# DDoS remediation

Once detected, there are at least two ways to stop the attack at the network
level:

- blackhole the traffic to the targeted user (_RTBH_), or
- selectively drop packets matching the attack patterns (_Flowspec_).

## Traffic blackhole

The easiest method is to sacrifice the attacked user. While this helps the
attacker, this protects your network. It is a method supported by all routers.
You can also offload this protection to many transit providers. This is useful
if the attack volume exceeds your internet capacity.

This works by advertising with BGP a route to the attacked user with a specific
community. The border router modifies the next hop address of these routes to a
specific IP address configured to forward the traffic to a null interface. [RFC
7999][] defines `65535:666` for this purpose. This is known as a
“remote-triggered blackhole” (RTBH) and is explained in more detail in [RFC
3882][].

It is also possible to blackhole the source of the attacks by leveraging
_unicast Reverse Path Forwarding_ (uRPF) from [RFC 3704][], as explained in [RFC
5635][]. However, uRPF can be a serious tax on your router resources. See
“[NCS5500 uRPF: Configuration and Impact on Scale][]” for an example of the kind
of restrictions you have to expect when enabling uRPF.

On the advertising side, we can use [BIRD][]. Here is a complete configuration
file to allow any router to collect them:

```junos hl_lines="18 24 25 30 31 32 33 34 35"
log stderr all;
router id 192.0.2.1;

protocol device {
  scan time 10;
}

protocol bgp exporter {
  ipv4 {
    import none;
    export where proto = "blackhole4";
  };
  ipv6 {
    import none;
    export where proto = "blackhole6";
  };
  local as 64666;
  neighbor range 192.0.2.0/24 external;
  multihop;
  dynamic name "exporter";
  dynamic name digits 2;
  graceful restart yes;
  graceful restart time 0;
  long lived graceful restart yes;
  long lived stale time 3600;  # keep routes for 1 hour!
}

protocol static blackhole4 {
  ipv4;
  route 203.0.113.206/32 blackhole {
    bgp_community.add((65535, 666));
  };
  route 203.0.113.68/32 blackhole {
    bgp_community.add((65535, 666));
  };
}
protocol static blackhole6 {
  ipv6;
}
```

We use [BGP long-lived graceful restart][BGP LLGR] to ensure routes are kept for
one hour, even if the BGP connection goes down, notably during maintenance.

On the receiver side, if you have a Cisco router running IOS XR, you can use the
following configuration to blackhole traffic received on the BGP session. As the
BGP session is dedicated to this usage, The community is not used, but you can
also forward these routes to your transit providers.

```cisco
router static
 vrf public
  address-family ipv4 unicast
   192.0.2.1/32 Null0 description "BGP blackhole"
  !
  address-family ipv6 unicast
   2001:db8::1/128 Null0 description "BGP blackhole"
  !
 !
!
route-policy blackhole_ipv4_in_public
  if destination in (0.0.0.0/0 le 31) then
    drop
  endif
  set next-hop 192.0.2.1
  done
end-policy
!
route-policy blackhole_ipv6_in_public
  if destination in (::/0 le 127) then
    drop
  endif
  set next-hop 2001:db8::1
  done
end-policy
!
router bgp 12322
 neighbor-group BLACKHOLE_IPV4_PUBLIC
  remote-as 64666
  ebgp-multihop 255
  update-source Loopback10
  address-family ipv4 unicast
   maximum-prefix 100 90
   route-policy blackhole_ipv4_in_public in
   route-policy drop out
   long-lived-graceful-restart stale-time send 86400 accept 86400
  !
  address-family ipv6 unicast
   maximum-prefix 100 90
   route-policy blackhole_ipv6_in_public in
   route-policy drop out
   long-lived-graceful-restart stale-time send 86400 accept 86400
  !
 !
 vrf public
  neighbor 192.0.2.1
   use neighbor-group BLACKHOLE_IPV4_PUBLIC
   description akvorado-1
```

When the traffic is blackholed, it is still reported by _IPFIX_ and _sFlow_.
In *Akvorado*, use `ForwardingStatus >= 128` as a filter.

While this method is compatible with all routers, it makes the attack successful
as the target is completely unreachable. If your router supports it, *Flowspec*
can selectively filter flows to **stop the attack without impacting the
customer**.

## Flowspec

*Flowspec* is defined in [RFC 8955][] and enables the transmission of flow
specifications in BGP sessions. A flow specification is a set of matching
criteria to apply to IP traffic. These criteria include the source and
destination prefix, the IP protocol, the source and destination port, and the
packet length. Each flow specification is associated with an action, encoded as an
extended community: traffic shaping, traffic marking, or redirection.

To announce flow specifications with *BIRD*, we extend our configuration. The
extended community used shapes the matching traffic to 0 byte per second.

```junos
flow4 table flowtab4;
flow6 table flowtab6;

protocol bgp exporter {
  flow4 {
    import none;
    export where proto = "flowspec4";
  };
  flow6 {
    import none;
    export where proto = "flowspec6";
  };
  # […]
}

protocol static flowspec4 {
  flow4;
  route flow4 {
    dst 203.0.113.68/32;
    sport = 53;
    length >= 1476 && <= 1500;
    proto = 17;
  }{
    bgp_ext_community.add((generic, 0x80060000, 0x00000000));
  };
  route flow4 {
    dst 203.0.113.206/32;
    sport = 123;
    length = 468;
    proto = 17;
  }{
    bgp_ext_community.add((generic, 0x80060000, 0x00000000));
  };
}
protocol static flowspec6 {
  flow6;
}
```

If you have a Cisco router running IOS XR, the configuration may look like
this:

```cisco
vrf public
 address-family ipv4 flowspec
 address-family ipv6 flowspec
!
router bgp 12322
 address-family vpnv4 flowspec
 address-family vpnv6 flowspec
 neighbor-group FLOWSPEC_IPV4_PUBLIC
  remote-as 64666
  ebgp-multihop 255
  update-source Loopback10
  address-family ipv4 flowspec
   long-lived-graceful-restart stale-time send 86400 accept 86400
   route-policy accept in
   route-policy drop out
   maximum-prefix 100 90
   validation disable
  !
  address-family ipv6 flowspec
   long-lived-graceful-restart stale-time send 86400 accept 86400
   route-policy accept in
   route-policy drop out
   maximum-prefix 100 90
   validation disable
  !
 !
 vrf public
  address-family ipv4 flowspec
  address-family ipv6 flowspec
  neighbor 192.0.2.1
   use neighbor-group FLOWSPEC_IPV4_PUBLIC
   description akvorado-1
```

Then, you need to enable _Flowspec_ on all interfaces with:

```cisco
flowspec
 vrf public
  address-family ipv4
   local-install interface-all
  !
  address-family ipv6
   local-install interface-all
  !
 !
!
```

As with the RTBH setup, you can filter dropped flows with `ForwardingStatus >=
128`.

# DDoS detection (continued)

In the example using _Flowspec_, the flows were also filtered on the length of the packet:

```junos
route flow4 {
  dst 203.0.113.68/32;
  sport = 53;
  length >= 1476 && <= 1500;
  proto = 17;
}{
  bgp_ext_community.add((generic, 0x80060000, 0x00000000));
};
```

This is an important addition: legitimate DNS requests are smaller than this and
therefore not filtered.[^dns] With _ClickHouse_, you can get the 10<sup>th</sup>
and 90<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the packet sizes with `quantiles(0.1,
0.9)(Bytes/Packets)`.

[^dns]: While most DNS clients should retry with TCP on failures, this is not
    always the case: until [recently][], [musl libc][] did not implement this.

The last issue we need to tackle is how to optimize the request: it may need
several seconds to collect the data and it is likely to consume substantial
resources from your *ClickHouse* database. One solution is to create a
materialized view to pre-aggregate results:

```sql hl_lines="11"
CREATE TABLE ddos_logs (
  TimeReceived DateTime,
  DstAddr IPv6,
  Proto UInt32,
  SrcPort UInt16,
  Gbps SimpleAggregateFunction(sum, Float64),
  Mpps SimpleAggregateFunction(sum, Float64),
  sources AggregateFunction(uniqCombined(12), IPv6),
  countries AggregateFunction(uniqCombined(12), FixedString(2)),
  size AggregateFunction(quantiles(0.1, 0.9), UInt64)
) ENGINE = SummingMergeTree
PARTITION BY toStartOfHour(TimeReceived)
ORDER BY (TimeReceived, DstAddr, Proto, SrcPort)
TTL toStartOfHour(TimeReceived) + INTERVAL 6 HOUR DELETE ;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ddos_logs_view TO ddos_logs AS
  SELECT
    toStartOfMinute(TimeReceived) AS TimeReceived,
    DstAddr,
    Proto,
    SrcPort,
    sum(((((Bytes * SamplingRate) * 8) / 1000) / 1000) / 1000) / 60 AS Gbps,
    sum(((Packets * SamplingRate) / 1000) / 1000) / 60 AS Mpps,
    uniqCombinedState(12)(SrcAddr) AS sources,
    uniqCombinedState(12)(SrcCountry) AS countries,
    quantilesState(0.1, 0.9)(toUInt64(Bytes/Packets)) AS size
  FROM flows
  WHERE DstNetRole = 'customers'
  GROUP BY
    TimeReceived,
    DstAddr,
    Proto,
    SrcPort
```

The `ddos_logs` table is using the `SummingMergeTree` engine. When the table
receives new data, _ClickHouse_ replaces all the rows with the same sorting key,
as defined by the `ORDER BY` directive, with one row which contains summarized
values using either the `sum()` function or the explicitly specified aggregate
function (`uniqCombined` and `quantiles` in our example).[^materialized]

[^materialized]: The materialized view also aggregates the data at hand, both
    for efficiency and to ensure we work with the right data types.

Finally, we can modify our initial query with the following one:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT
    TimeReceived,
    DstAddr,
    dictGetOrDefault('protocols', 'name', Proto, '???') AS Proto,
    SrcPort,
    sum(Gbps) AS Gbps,
    sum(Mpps) AS Mpps,
    uniqCombinedMerge(12)(sources) AS sources,
    uniqCombinedMerge(12)(countries) AS countries,
    quantilesMerge(0.1, 0.9)(size) AS size
  FROM ddos_logs
  WHERE TimeReceived > now() - INTERVAL 60 MINUTE
  GROUP BY
    TimeReceived,
    DstAddr,
    Proto,
    SrcPort
)
WHERE (Gbps > 1)
   OR ((Proto = 'UDP') AND (Gbps > 0.2)) 
   OR ((sources > 20) AND (Gbps > 0.1)) 
   OR ((countries > 10) AND (Gbps > 0.1))
ORDER BY
  TimeReceived DESC,
  Gbps DESC
```

# Gluing everything together

To sum up, building an anti-DDoS system requires to following these steps:

1. define a set of criteria to detect a DDoS attack,
2. translate these criteria into SQL requests,
3. pre-aggregate flows into `SummingMergeTree` tables,
4. query and transform the results to a _BIRD_ configuration file, and
5. configure your routers to pull the routes from _BIRD_.

A Python script like the following one can handle the fourth step. For each
attacked target, it generates both a _Flowspec_ rule and a blackhole route.

```python
{% raw %}
import socket
import types
