In the past week, I ran a lot of benchmarks using a
[Spirent Avalanche][avalanche] which is an appliance providing
performance testing of network related products (a load balancer, a
router, a web server, ...). The reporting module does not provide a
lot of flexibility and the plots are not the most beautiful
ones. Fortunately, the results are also exported as CSV.

[matplotlib][mplib] is a python plotting library which produces great
figures without making things hard when they should be easy. It is a
good replacement for [GNU Plot][gnuplot] and you don't need a lot of
Python knowledge to use it. The documentation includes a fine
[user's guide][users] that should get you started in less than 20
minutes.

# Quick introduction

You can use *matplotlib* from [IPython][ipython] to experiment:

    ::console
    $ ipython -pylab
    Python 2.6.7 (r267:88850, Jul 10 2011, 08:11:54) 
    Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

      Welcome to pylab, a matplotlib-based Python environment.
      For more information, type 'help(pylab)'.

    > In [1]: plot([1,1,4,5,10,11])

When you are ready, you can build a simple Python script:

    ::python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    from matplotlib.pylab import *
    plot([1,1,4,5,10,11])
    savefig("my-plot.pdf")

# Grabbing results from CSV

Data are contained into a file named `realtime.csv`. It contains the
raw data as well as some general information about the benchmark (test
name, description, paramaters...). We need to skip those. Fortunately,
`csv2rec()` allows us to load data from a CSV file into a record array
and skip the first rows if necessary.

    ::python
    from matplotlib.pylab import *
    import sys, os
    import gzip

    skip = 0
    for line in gzip.open(sys.argv[1]):
        if line.startswith("Seconds Elapsed,"):
            break
        skip = skip + 1
    ava = csv2rec(gzip.open(sys.argv[1]),skiprows=skip)

Now, the "Elapsed seconds" column can be accessed with
`ava['elapsed_seconds']`.

# General structure

I need 4 plots:

* successful, unsuccesful and attempted transactions per second,
* minimum, average and maximum response time per page,
* Avalanche CPU usage,
* incoming and outgoing bandwidth.

The most important plot is the first one. The second one is less
important and the last ones are here only to check we did not hit some
bottleneck during the benchmark. We want to produce a page like this:

![General structure][s1]
[s1]: [[!!images/matplotlib/structure.png]] "General plot layout"

*matplotlib* allows us to plot subfigures. We create 4 subfigures sharing
the same X axis (which the number of seconds elapsed since the
beginning of the benchmark). We save the result to PDF.

    ::python
    # Create the figure (A4 format)
    figure(num=None, figsize=(8.27, 11.69), dpi=100)

    ax1 = subplot2grid((4, 2), (0, 0), rowspan=2, colspan=2)
    # [...]
    ax2 = subplot2grid((4, 2), (2, 0), colspan=2, sharex=ax1)
    # [...]
    ax3 = subplot2grid((4, 2), (3, 0), sharex=ax1)
    # [...]
    ax4 = subplot2grid((4, 2), (3, 1), sharex=ax1)
    # [...]

    # Save to PDF
    savefig("%s.pdf" % TITLE)

# Bandwidth plot

Let's start with the easiest plot: bandwidth usage.

    ::python
    # Plot 4: Bandwidth
    ax4 = subplot2grid((4, 2), (3, 1), sharex=ax1)
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'], ava['incoming_traffic_kbps']/1000.,
         'b-', label='Incoming traffic')
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'], -ava['outgoing_traffic_kbps']/1000.,
         'r-', label='Outgoing traffic')
    grid(True, which="both", linestyle="dotted")
    ylabel("Mbps", fontsize=7)
    xticks(fontsize=7)
    yticks(fontsize=7)

Here, in the suplot positioned in `(3,1)`, we plot the number of
seconds elapsed versus the incoming traffic with a blue line (`b-`). We
also plot the seconds elapsed versus the outgoing traffic with a red
line (`r-`).

Here is the result:

![Bandwidth plot][s2]
[s2]: [[!!images/matplotlib/bandwidth.png]] "Bandwidth plot"

Most functions of *matplotlib* are exposed as a method of the object
they refer to and as a global function. In the latest case, the
function is applied to the latest created figure or plotting area. For
example, `plot()` is called a function and therefore refer to the
plotting area `ax4`. We could have written `ax4.plot()` instead.

# CPU plot

The average CPU utilization data available in the CSV file needs to be
normalized. We assume the Avalanche to be mostly idle on start. The
plotting part is pretty similar to our previous case.

    ::python
    # CPU
    max = np.max(ava['average_cpu_utilization'])
    order = 10**np.floor(np.log10(max))
    max = np.ceil(max/order)*order
    cpu = (max - ava['average_cpu_utilization'])*100/max
    
    # Plot 3: CPU
    ax3 = subplot2grid((4, 2), (3, 0), sharex=ax1)
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'],
         cpu,
         'r-', label="Avalanche CPU")
    grid(True, which="both", linestyle="dotted")
    ylabel("Avalanche CPU%", fontsize=7)
    xticks(fontsize=7)
    yticks(fontsize=7)

# Response time

We would like to plot response time. We have three corresponding
metrics: minimum response time, average response time, maximum
response time. Because those metrics start from 0 ms up to several
seconds, a logarithmic scale is used:

    ::python
    # Plot 2: response time
    ax2 = subplot2grid((4, 2), (2, 0), colspan=2, sharex=ax1)
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'], ava['minimum_response_time_per_page_msec'],
         'b-', label="Minimum response time")
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'], ava['maximum_response_time_per_page_msec'],
         'r-', label="Maximum response time")
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'], ava['average_response_time_per_page_msec'],
         'g-', linewidth=2, label="Average response time")
    legend(loc='upper left', fancybox=True, shadow=True, prop=dict(size=8))
    grid(True, which="major", linestyle="dotted")
    yscale("log")
    ylabel("Response time (msec)", fontsize=9)
    xticks(fontsize=9)
    yticks(fontsize=9)

This is also the first graphic with a legend.

# Transactions per second

The most important plot is the number of transactions per second.

    ::python
    # Plot 1: TPS
    ax1 = subplot2grid((4, 2), (0, 0), rowspan=2, colspan=2)
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'], ava['desired_load_transactionssec'],
         '-', color='0.7', label="Desired Load")
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'], ava['successful_transactionssecond'],
         'g:', label="Successful")
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'], smooth(ava['successful_transactionssecond']),
         'g-', linewidth=2)
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'], ava['attempted_transactionssecond'],
         'b-', label="Attempted")
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'], ava['aborted_transactionssecond'],
         'k-', label="Aborted")
    plot(ava['seconds_elapsed'][:-1], ava['unsuccessful_transactionssecond'][:-1],
         'r-', label="Unsuccessful")
    legend(loc='upper left', fancybox=True, shadow=True, prop=dict(size=10))
    grid(True, which="both", linestyle="dotted")
    ylabel("Transactions/s")

The number of successful transactions is plotted twice: when the
benchmarked equipment becomes overloaded, we get a lot of noise in
this metric and it can be difficult to read. Therefore, we plot a
smoothed version with the help of [NumPy][numpy]:

    ::python
    import numpy as np
    def smooth(x, win=4):
        s = np.r_[x[win-1:0:-1],x,x[-1:-win:-1]]
        w = np.ones(win, 'd')
        y = np.convolve(w/w.sum(),s,mode='valid')
        return y[(win-1)/2:-(win-1)/2]

`np.r_()` is just here to extend our data by the size of the
window. `np.ones()` build a weight vector of the size of the
window. If the window is 4, we get `[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]`. We use
this vector to apply a [convolution][convolution] to the original
data. Here is the result:

![Transactions plot][s4]
[s4]: [[!!images/matplotlib/tps.png]] "TPS plot"

The original data is a green dotted line while the smoothed one is a
green thick line. What about the three annotations? *matplotlib*
allows us to put annotations on a figure. Here is how this is done:

    ::python
    # Noticeable points
    count = 0
    def highlight(index, reason):
        global count
        if index and index > 0:
            x,y = (ava['seconds_elapsed'][index],
                   smooth(ava['successful_transactionssecond'])[index])
            plot([x], [y], 'ko')
            annotate('%d TPS\n(%s)' % (y,reason), xy=(x,y),
                     xytext=(20, -(count+4.7)*22), textcoords='axes points',
                     arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="-",
                     connectionstyle="angle,angleA=0,angleB=80,rad=10"),
                     horizontalalignment='left',
                     verticalalignment='bottom',
                     fontsize=8)
            count = count + 1

    highlight(np.argmax(smooth(ava['successful_transactionssecond'])), "Max TPS")
    highlight(np.argmax(cpu > 99), "CPU>99%")
    highlight(np.argmax(ava['average_response_time_per_page_msec'] > 500), ">500ms")
    highlight(np.argmax(ava['average_response_time_per_page_msec'] > 100), ">100ms")

`np.argmax()` returns the index of the first maximum value. The trick
here is that when I write `ava['average_response_time_per_page_msec'] > 100`,
I get an array with 1 when the value is more than 100 and 0
otherwise. Therefore, `np.argmax()` will return the first index where
the value is superior to 100 ms.

The `highlight()` function will add a point (`plot([x], [y], 'ko')`)
on the smoothed successful transactions par second plot and add an
annotation with some fancy arrow.

Look at this [benchmark of nginx as SSL termination][pdf] for a
complete output of this script.
