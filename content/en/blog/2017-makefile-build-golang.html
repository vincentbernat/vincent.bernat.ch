!!! "Update (2019-07)" [Go 1.11][] introduces modules to manage
dependencies without using `GOPATH`. While some aspects of the
`Makefile` presented here are still relevant (fetching tools, running
tests), the main point becomes moot. See the [updated
version]([[en/blog/2019-makefile-build-golang.html]]) of this guide.

My most loathed feature of [Go][] is the mandatory use of `GOPATH`:
**I do not want to put my own code next to its
dependencies**. Hopefully, this issue is slowly starting to
be [accepted][] by the main authors. In the meantime, you can
workaround this problem with more opinionated tools (like [gb][]) or
by crafting your own `Makefile`.

For the latter, you can have a look at [Filippo Valsorda's example][]
or my [own take][] which I describe in more details here. This is not
meant to be a universal `Makefile` but a relatively short one with
some batteries included. It comes with a simple "Hello World!"
application.

# Project structure

For a standalone project, [vendoring][] is a must-have[^vendoring] as
you cannot rely on your dependencies to not
introduce [backward-incompatible changes][]. Some packages are
using [versioned URLs][] but most of them aren't. There is
currently [no standard tool to handle vendoring][]. My personal take
is to **vendor all dependencies** with [Glide][].[^godep]

[^vendoring]: In Go, "vendoring" is about both *bundling* and
    *dependency management*. As the Go ecosystem matures, the
    *bundling* part (fixed snapshots of dependencies) may become
    optional but the `vendor/` directory may stay for dependency
    management (retrieval of the latest versions of dependencies
    matching a set of constraints).

[^godep]: [Another branch][own take godep] is using `go dep`, the
    [<del>official</del> package manager for Go][godep].

It is a good practice to split an application into different packages
while the main one stay fairly small. In the `hellogopher` example,
the CLI is handled in the `cmd` package while the application logic
for printing greetings is in the `hello` package:

    .
    ├── cmd/
    │   ├── hello.go
    │   ├── root.go
    │   └── version.go
    ├── glide.lock (generated)
    ├── glide.yaml
    ├── vendor/ (dependencies will go there)
    ├── hello/
    │   ├── root.go
    │   └── root_test.go
    ├── main.go
    ├── Makefile
    └── README.md

# Down the rabbit hole

Let's take a look at the various "features" of the `Makefile`.

## `GOPATH` handling

Since all dependencies are vendored, only our own project needs to be
in the `GOPATH`:

    ::make
    PACKAGE  = hellogopher
    GOPATH   = $(CURDIR)/.gopath
    BASE     = $(GOPATH)/src/$(PACKAGE)
    
    $(BASE):
    	@mkdir -p $(dir $@)
    	@ln -sf $(CURDIR) $@

The base import path is `hellogopher`, not
`github.com/vincentbernat/hellogopher`: this shortens imports and
makes them easily distinguishable from imports of dependency
packages. However, your application won't be `go get`-able. This is a
personal choice and can be adjusted with the `$(PACKAGE)` variable.

We just create a symlink from `.gopath/src/hellogopher` to our root
directory. The `GOPATH` environment variable is automatically exported
to the shell commands of the recipes. Any tool should work fine after
changing the current directory to `$(BASE)`. For example, this
snippet builds the executable:

    ::make
    .PHONY: all
    all: | $(BASE)
    	cd $(BASE) && $(GO) build -o bin/$(PACKAGE) main.go

## Vendoring dependencies

*Glide* is a bit like Ruby's [Bundler][]. In `glide.yaml`, you specify
what **packages you need** and the **constraints you want** on
them. *Glide* computes a `glide.lock` file containing the exact
versions for each dependencies (including recursive dependencies) and
download them in the `vendor/` folder. I choose to check into the VCS
both `glide.yaml` and `glide.lock` files. It's also possible to only
check in the first one or to also check in the `vendor/` directory. A
work-in-progress is currently ongoing to provide
a [standard dependency management tool][] with a similar workflow.

We define two rules:[^auto]

    ::make
    GLIDE = glide

    glide.lock: glide.yaml | $(BASE)
    	cd $(BASE) && $(GLIDE) update
    	@touch $@
    vendor: glide.lock | $(BASE)
    	cd $(BASE) && $(GLIDE) --quiet install
    	@ln -sf . vendor/src
    	@touch $@

We use a variable to invoke `glide`. This enables a user to easily
override it (for example, with `make GLIDE=$GOPATH/bin/glide`).

[^auto]: If you don't want to automatically update `glide.lock` when a
    change is detected in `glide.yaml`, rename the target to
    `deps-update` and make it a phony target.

## Using third-party tools

Most projects need some third-party tools. We can either expect
them to be already installed or **compile them** in our private
`GOPATH`. For example, here is the lint rule:

    ::make
    BIN    = $(GOPATH)/bin
    GOLINT = $(BIN)/golint
    
    $(BIN)/golint: | $(BASE) # ❶
    	go get github.com/golang/lint/golint
    
    .PHONY: lint
    lint: vendor | $(BASE) $(GOLINT) # ❷
    	@cd $(BASE) && ret=0 && for pkg in $(PKGS); do \
    		test -z "$$($(GOLINT) $$pkg | tee /dev/stderr)" || ret=1 ; \
    	 done ; exit $$ret

As for `glide`, we let the user a chance to override which `golint`
executable to use. By default, it uses a private copy. But a user can
use its own copy with `make GOLINT=/usr/bin/golint`.

In ❶, we have the recipe to build the private copy. We issue `go
get`[^irony] to download and build `golint`. In ❷, the `lint` rule
executes `golint` on each package contained in the `$(PKGS)`
variable. We'll explain this variable in the next section.

[^irony]: There is some irony for bad mouthing `go get` and then
    immediately use it because it is convenient.

## Working with non-vendored packages only

Some commands need to be provided with a list of packages. Because we
use a `vendor/` directory, the shortcut `./...` is not what we expect
as we don't want to run tests on our
dependencies.[^recursive] Therefore, we **compose a list of packages
we care about**:


    ::make
    PKGS = $(or $(PKG), $(shell cd $(BASE) && \
        env GOPATH=$(GOPATH) $(GO) list ./... | grep -v "^$(PACKAGE)/vendor/"))

[^recursive]: I think `./...` should not include the `vendor/`
    directory by default. Dependencies should be trusted to have run
    their own tests in the environment they expect them to
    succeed. <del>Unfortunately, this is [unlikely to change][].</del>

If the user has provided the `$(PKG)` variable, we use it. For
example, if they want to lint only the `cmd` package, they
can invoke `make lint PKG=hellogopher/cmd` which is more intuitive
than specifying `PKGS`.

Otherwise, we just execute `go list ./...` but we remove anything from
the `vendor/` directory.

!!! "Update (2018-03)" Since [Go 1.9][], `./...` no longer matches
packages in the `vendor/` directory.

## Tests

Here are some rules to run tests:

    ::make
    TIMEOUT = 20
    TEST_TARGETS := test-default test-bench test-short test-verbose test-race
    .PHONY: $(TEST_TARGETS) check test tests
    test-bench:   ARGS=-run=__absolutelynothing__ -bench=.
    test-short:   ARGS=-short
    test-verbose: ARGS=-v
    test-race:    ARGS=-race
    $(TEST_TARGETS): test
    
    check test tests: fmt lint vendor | $(BASE)
    	@cd $(BASE) && $(GO) test -timeout $(TIMEOUT)s $(ARGS) $(PKGS)

A user can invoke tests in different ways:

 - `make test` runs all tests;
 - `make test TIMEOUT=10` runs all tests with a timeout of 10 seconds;
 - `make test PKG=hellogopher/cmd` only runs tests for the `cmd` package;
 - `make test ARGS="-v -short"` runs tests with the specified arguments;
 - `make test-race` runs tests with race detector enabled.

## Tests coverage

`go test` includes a test coverage tool. Unfortunately, it only
handles **one package at a time** and you have to explicitly **list
the packages to be instrumented**, otherwise the instrumentation is
limited to the currently tested package. If you provide too many
packages, the compilation time will skyrocket. Moreover, if you want
an output compatible with *Jenkins*, you'll need some additional
tools.

    ::make
    COVERAGE_MODE    = atomic
    COVERAGE_PROFILE = $(COVERAGE_DIR)/profile.out
    COVERAGE_XML     = $(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage.xml
    COVERAGE_HTML    = $(COVERAGE_DIR)/index.html
    
    .PHONY: test-coverage test-coverage-tools
    test-coverage-tools: | $(GOCOVMERGE) $(GOCOV) $(GOCOVXML) # ❸
    test-coverage: COVERAGE_DIR := $(CURDIR)/test/coverage.$(shell date -Iseconds)
    test-coverage: fmt lint vendor test-coverage-tools | $(BASE)
    	@mkdir -p $(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage
    	@cd $(BASE) && for pkg in $(PKGS); do \ # ❹
    		$(GO) test \
    			-coverpkg=$$($(GO) list -f {% raw %}'{{ join .Deps "\n" }}'{% endraw %} $$pkg | \
    					grep '^$(PACKAGE)/' | grep -v '^$(PACKAGE)/vendor/' | \
    					tr '\n' ',')$$pkg \
    			-covermode=$(COVERAGE_MODE) \
    			-coverprofile="$(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage/`echo $$pkg | tr "/" "-"`.cover" $$pkg ;\
    	 done
    	@$(GOCOVMERGE) $(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage/*.cover > $(COVERAGE_PROFILE)
    	@$(GO) tool cover -html=$(COVERAGE_PROFILE) -o $(COVERAGE_HTML)
    	@$(GOCOV) convert $(COVERAGE_PROFILE) | $(GOCOVXML) > $(COVERAGE_XML)

First, we define some variables to let the user override them. We also
require the following tools (in ❸):

 - `gocovmerge` merges profiles from different runs into a single one;
 - `gocov-xml` converts a coverage profile to the [Cobertura][] format;
 - `gocov` is needed to convert a coverage profile to a format handled
   by `gocov-xml`.

The rules to build these tools are similar to the rule for `golint`
described a few sections ago.

In ❹, for each package to test, we run `go test` with the
`-coverprofile` argument. We also explicitly provide the list of
packages to instrument to `-coverpkg` by using `go list` to get a list
of dependencies for the tested package and keeping only our owns.

# Final result

While the main goal of using a `Makefile` was to work around `GOPATH`,
it's also a good place to hide the complexity of some operations,
notably around test coverage.
