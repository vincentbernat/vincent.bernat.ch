To experiment with network stuff, I was using
[UML-based network labs][uml-lab]. Many alternatives exist, like
[GNS3][], [Netkit][], [Marionnet][] or [Cloonix][]. All of them are
great viable solutions but I still prefer to stick to my minimal
home-made solution with UML virtual machines. Here is why:

 - I didn't want to use **disk images**. They take a lot of space and
   they have to be maintained. They also become cluttered, especially
   if you try to reuse them across several labs. They are also
   difficult to share.
 - I want to be able to access my **home directory**. It contains the
   important configuration files related to the lab and I can put them
   in the right place thanks to symbolic links when the lab starts. It
   also makes exchanging files with the lab quite easy.
 - I don't want to **boot a complete system**. This allows me to be
   cheap on memory and each virtual system should boot in a few
   seconds.

The use of UML had some drawbacks:

 - It may be buggy. For example, it is currently not possible to use
   [gdbserver inside UML][] without a patch. Sometimes, the kernel
   won't even compile.
 - It is slow.

However, UML features [HostFS][], a filesystem providing access to any
part of the host filesystem. This is the killer feature which allows
me to not use any virtual disk image and to get access to my home
directory right from the guest.

I discovered recently that QEMU provided [9P][], a similar filesystem
on top of VirtIO, the paravirtualized IO framework.

# Setting up the lab

The setup of the lab is done with a
[single self-contained shell file][setup]. The layout is similar to
[what I have done with UML][uml-lab]. I will only highlight here the
most interesting steps.

## Booting QEMU with a minimal kernel

My initial goal was to experiment with
[Nicolas Dichtel's IPv6 ECMP patch][ecmp-ipv6]. Therefore, I needed to
configure a custom kernel. I have started from `make defconfig`,
removed everything that was not necessary, added what I needed for my
lab (mostly network stuff) and added the appropriate options for VirtIO
drivers:

    ::
    CONFIG_NET_9P_VIRTIO=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO_CONSOLE=y
    CONFIG_HW_RANDOM_VIRTIO=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO_RING=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO_BALLOON=y
    CONFIG_VIRTIO_MMIO=y

No modules. Grab the [complete configuration][.config] if you want to
have a look.

From here, you can start your kernel with the following command
(`$LINUX` is the appropriate `bzImage`):

    ::sh
    qemu-system-x86_64 \
      -m 256m \
      -display none \
      -nodefconfig -no-user-config -nodefaults \
      \
      -chardev stdio,id=charserial0,signal=off \
      -device isa-serial,chardev=charserial0,id=serial0 \
      \
      -chardev socket,id=con0,path=$TMP/vm-$name-console.pipe,server,nowait \
      -mon chardev=con0,mode=readline,default \
      \
      -kernel $LINUX \
      -append "init=/bin/sh console=ttyS0"

Since there is no disk to boot from, the kernel will panic when trying
to mount the root filesystem. QEMU is configured to not display video
output (`-display none`). A serial port is defined and uses `stdio` as
a backend.[^signal] The kernel is configured to use this serial port
as a console (`console=ttyS0`). A VirtIO console could have been used
instead but it seems this is not possible to make it work early in the
boot process.

[^signal]: `stdio` is configured such that signals are not
           enabled. QEMU won't stop when receiving `SIGINT`. This is
           important for the usage we want to have.

The QEMU monitor is setup to listen on a Unix socket. It is possible
to connect to it with `socat UNIX:$TMP/vm-$name-console.pipe -`.

## Initial ramdisk

!!! "Update (2012-10)" I was initially unable to mount the host
filesystem as the root filesystem for the guest directly by the
kernel. In a comment, [Josh Triplett](https://joshtriplett.org/) told
me to use `/dev/root` as the mount tag to solve this problem. I keep
using an _initrd_ in this post but the lab on [GitHub][setup] has been
updated to not use one.

Here is how to build a small initial ramdisk:

    ::sh
    # Setup initrd
    setup_initrd() {
        info "Build initrd"
        DESTDIR=$TMP/initrd
        mkdir -p $DESTDIR

        # Setup busybox
        copy_exec $($WHICH busybox) /bin/busybox
        for applet in $(${DESTDIR}/bin/busybox --list); do
            ln -s busybox ${DESTDIR}/bin/${applet}
        done

        # Setup init
        cp $PROGNAME ${DESTDIR}/init

        cd "${DESTDIR}" && find . | \
           cpio --quiet -R 0:0 -o -H newc | \
           gzip > $TMP/initrd.gz
    }

The `copy_exec` function is stolen from the `initramfs-tools` package
in Debian. It will ensure that the appropriate libraries are also
copied. Another solution would have been to use a static `busybox`.

The setup script is copied as `/init` in the initial ramdisk. It will
detect it has been invoked as such. If it was omitted, a shell would
be spawned instead. Remove the `cp` call if you want to experiment
manually.

The flag `-initrd` allows QEMU to use this initial ramdisk.

## Root filesystem

Let's mount our root filesystem using _9P_. This is quite easy. First
QEMU needs to be configured to export the host filesystem to
the guest:

    ::sh
    qemu-system-x86_64 \
      ${PREVIOUS_ARGS} \
      -fsdev local,security_model=passthrough,id=fsdev-root,path=${ROOT},readonly \
      -device virtio-9p-pci,id=fs-root,fsdev=fsdev-root,mount_tag=rootshare

`${ROOT}` can either be `/` or any directory containing a complete
filesystem. Mounting it from the guest is quite easy:

    ::sh
    mkdir -p /target/ro
    mount -t 9p rootshare /target/ro -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.u

You should find a complete root filesystem inside `/target/ro`. I have
used `version=9p2000.u` instead of `version=9p2000.L` because the
latter does not allow a program to `mount()` a host mount
point.[^9pversion]

[^9pversion]: Therefore, it is not possible to mound a fresh `/proc`
              on top of the existing one. I have searched a bit but
              didn't find why. Any comments on this is welcome.

Now, you have a read-only root filesystem (because you don't want to
mess with your existing root filesystem and moreover, you did not run
this lab as root, did you?). Let's use a union filesystem. Debian
comes with [AUFS][] while Ubuntu and OpenWRT have migrated to
[overlayfs][]. I was previously using AUFS but got errors on some
specific cases. It is still not clear
[which one will end up in the kernel][lwn-overlayfs]. So, let's try
_overlayfs_.

I didn't find any patchset ready to be applied on top of my kernel
tree. I was working with [David Miller's net-next tree][davem]. Here
is how I have applied the _overlayfs_ patch on top of it:

    ::console
    $ git remote add torvalds git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
    $ git fetch torvalds
    $ git remote add overlayfs git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mszeredi/vfs.git
    $ git fetch overlayfs
    $ git merge-base overlayfs.v15 v3.6
    4cbe5a555fa58a79b6ecbb6c531b8bab0650778d
    $ git checkout -b net-next+overlayfs
    $ git cherry-pick 4cbe5a555fa58a79b6ecbb6c531b8bab0650778d..overlayfs.v15

Don't forget to enable `CONFIG_OVERLAYFS_FS` in `.config`. Here is how
I configured the whole root filesystem:

    ::sh
    info "Setup overlayfs"
    mkdir /target
    mkdir /target/ro
    mkdir /target/rw
    mkdir /target/overlay
    # Version 9p2000.u allows one to access /dev, /sys and mount new
    # partitions over them. This is not the case for 9p2000.L.
    mount -t 9p        rootshare /target/ro      -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.u
    mount -t tmpfs     tmpfs     /target/rw      -o rw
    mount -t overlayfs overlayfs /target/overlay -o lowerdir=/target/ro,upperdir=/target/rw
    mount -n -t proc  proc /target/overlay/proc
    mount -n -t sysfs sys  /target/overlay/sys

    info "Mount home directory on /root"
    mount -t 9p homeshare /target/overlay/root -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,access=0,rw

    info "Mount lab directory on /lab"
    mkdir /target/overlay/lab
    mount -t 9p labshare /target/overlay/lab -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,access=0,rw

    info "Chroot"
    export STATE=1
    cp "$PROGNAME" /target/overlay
    exec chroot /target/overlay "$PROGNAME"

You have to export your `${HOME}` and the lab directory from host:

    ::sh
    qemu-system-x86_64 \
      ${PREVIOUS_ARGS} \
      -fsdev local,security_model=passthrough,id=fsdev-root,path=${ROOT},readonly \
      -device virtio-9p-pci,id=fs-root,fsdev=fsdev-root,mount_tag=rootshare \
      -fsdev local,security_model=none,id=fsdev-home,path=${HOME} \
      -device virtio-9p-pci,id=fs-home,fsdev=fsdev-home,mount_tag=homeshare \
      -fsdev local,security_model=none,id=fsdev-lab,path=$(dirname "$PROGNAME") \
      -device virtio-9p-pci,id=fs-lab,fsdev=fsdev-lab,mount_tag=labshare

## Network

You know what is missing from our network lab? Network setup. For each
LAN that I will need, I spawn a VDE switch:

    ::sh
    # Setup a VDE switch
    setup_switch() {
        info "Setup switch $1"
        screen -t "sw-$1" \
            start-stop-daemon --make-pidfile --pidfile "$TMP/switch-$1.pid" \
            --start --startas $($WHICH vde_switch) -- \
            --sock "$TMP/switch-$1.sock"
        screen -X select 0
    }

To attach an interface to the newly created LAN, I use:

    ::sh
    mac=$(echo $name-$net | sha1sum | \
                awk '{print "52:54:" substr($1,0,2) ":" substr($1, 2, 2) ":" substr($1, 4, 2) ":" substr($1, 6, 2)}')
    qemu-system-x86_64 \
      ${PREVIOUS_ARGS} \
      -net nic,model=virtio,macaddr=$mac,vlan=$net \
      -net vde,sock=$TMP/switch-$net.sock,vlan=$net

The use of a VDE switch allows me to run the lab as a non-root
user. It is possible to give Internet access to each VM, either by
using `-net user` flag or using `slirpvde` on a special switch. I
prefer the latter solution since it will allow the VM to speak to each
others.

# Debugging

This lab was mostly done to debug both the kernel and Quagga. Each of
them can be debugged remotely.

## Kernel debugging

While the kernel features [KGDB][], its own debugger, compatible with
[GDB][], it is easier to use the _remote GDB server_ built inside
QEMU.

    ::sh
    qemu-system-x86_64 \
      ${PREVIOUS_ARGS} \
      -gdb unix:$TMP/vm-$name-gdb.pipe,server,nowait

To connect to the remote GDB server from the host, first locate the
`vmlinux` file at the root of the source tree and run GDB on it. The
kernel has to be compiled with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y` to get the
appropriate debugging symbols. Then, use `socat` with the Unix socket
to attach to the remote debugger:

    ::console
    $ gdb vmlinux
    GNU gdb (GDB) 7.4.1-debian
    Reading symbols from /home/bernat/src/linux/vmlinux...done.
    (gdb) target remote | socat UNIX:$TMP/vm-r1-gdb.pipe -
    Remote debugging using | socat UNIX:/tmp/tmp.W36qWnrCEj/vm-r1-gdb.pipe -
    native_safe_halt () at /home/bernat/src/linux/arch/x86/include/asm/irqflags.h:50
    50  }
    (gdb)

You can now set breakpoints and resume the execution of the kernel.

It is easier to debug the kernel if optimizations are not
enabled. However, it is not possible to
[disable them globally][gcc20217]. You can however disable them
for some files. For example, to debug `net/ipv6/route.c`, add
`CFLAGS_route.o = -O0` to `net/ipv6/Makefile`, remove
`net/ipv6/route.o` and type `make`.

## Userland debugging

To debug a program inside QEMU, you can just use `gdb` as usual. Your
`$HOME` directory is available and it should be therefore
straightforward. However, if you want to perform some remote
debugging, that's quite easy. Add a new serial port to QEMU:

    ::sh
    qemu-system-x86_64 \
      ${PREVIOUS_ARGS} \
      -chardev socket,id=charserial1,path=$TMP/vm-$name-serial.pipe,server,nowait \
      -device isa-serial,chardev=charserial1,id=serial1

Starts `gdbserver` in the guest:

    ::console
    $ libtool execute gdbserver /dev/ttyS1 zebra/zebra
    Process /root/code/orange/quagga/build/zebra/.libs/lt-zebra created; pid = 800
    Remote debugging using /dev/ttyS1

And from the host, you can attach to the remote process:

    ::console
    $ libtool execute gdb zebra/zebra
    GNU gdb (GDB) 7.4.1-debian
    Reading symbols from /home/bernat/code/orange/quagga/build/zebra/.libs/lt-zebra...done.
    (gdb) target remote | socat UNIX:/tmp/tmp.W36qWnrCEj/vm-r1-serial.pipe -
    Remote debugging using | socat UNIX:/tmp/tmp.W36qWnrCEj/vm-r1-serial.pipe -
    Reading symbols from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
    Loaded symbols for /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
    0x00007ffff7dddaf0 in ?? () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
    (gdb)
