title: "Fixing layout shifts caused by web fonts"
description: |
   Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) measures the visual stability
   of a web page by quantifying unexpected layout shifts. New
   CSS properties offer a solution to layout shifts caused by web fonts.

In 2020, Google introduced [Core Web Vitals metrics][] to measure some aspects
of real-world user experience on the web. This blog has consistently achieved
good scores for two of these metrics: [Largest Contentful Paint][] and
[Interaction to Next Paint][]. However, optimizing the third metric, [Cumulative
Layout Shift][], which measures unexpected layout changes, has been more
challenging. Let's face it: optimizing for this metric is not really useful for
a site like this one. But getting a better score is always a good distraction. ðŸ’¯

To prevent the "flash of invisible text" when using web fonts, developers should
set the `font-display` property to `swap` in `@font-face` rules. This method
allows browsers to initially render text using a fallback font, then replace it
with the web font after loading. While this improves the LCP score, it causes
content reflow and layout shifts if the fallback and web fonts are not
metrically compatible. These shifts negatively affect the CLS score. CSS
provides properties to address this issue by overriding font metrics when using
fallback fonts: [`size-adjust`][size-adjust],
[`ascent-override`][ascent-override], [`descent-override`][descent-override],
and [`line-gap-override`][line-gap-override].

Two comprehensive articles explain each property and their computation methods
in detail: [Creating Perfect Font Fallbacks in CSS][] and [Improved font
fallbacks][].

# Interactive tuning tool

Instead of computing each property from font average metrics, I put together a
tool for interactively tuning fallback fonts.[^others]

[^others]: Similar tools already exist, like the [Fallback Font Generator][],
    but they were missing a few features, such as the ability to load the
    fallback font or to have decimals for the CSS properties. And no source
    code.

## Instructions

1. Load your custom font.

2. Select a fallback font to tune.

3. Adjust the `size-adjust` property to match the width of your custom font with
   the fallback font. With a proportional font, it is not possible to achieve a
   perfect match.

4. Fine-tune the `ascent-override` property. Aim to align the final dot of the
   last paragraph while monitoring the font's baseline. For more precise
   adjustment, disable the "<label for="lf1-support-line-height">Set line
   height</label>" option.

5. Modify the `descent-override` property. The goal is to make the two boxes
   match. You may need to alternate between this and the previous property for
   optimal results.

6. If necessary, adjust the `line-gap-override` property. This step is typically
   not required.

The process needs to be repeated for each fallback font. Some platforms may not
include certain fonts. Notably, Android lacks most fonts found in other
operating systems. It replaces *Georgia* with *Noto Serif*, which is not
metrically-compatible.

## Tool

The tool requires JavaScript.

BGP confederation is a technique used to reduce the number of internal BGP
sessions and improve scalability in large autonomous systems (AS). It divides an
AS into sub-ASes. Most eBGP rules apply between sub-ASes, except that next-hop,
MED, and local preferences remain unchanged. The AS path length ignores
contributions from confederation sub-ASes. BGP confederation is rarely used and
BGP route reflection is typically preferred for scaling.<br>AS override is a
feature that allows a router to replace the ASN of a neighbor in the AS path of
outgoing BGP routes with its own. It's useful when two distinct autonomous
systems share the same ASN. However, it interferes with BGP's loop prevention
mechanism and should be used cautiously.

## Results

For the body text of this blog, I get the following CSS definition:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Merriweather;
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: url("../fonts/merriweather.woff2") format("woff2");
  font-display: swap;
}
@font-face {
  font-family: "Fallback for Merriweather";
  src: local("Noto Serif"), local("Droid Serif");
  size-adjust: 98.3%;
  ascent-override: 99%;
  descent-override: 27%;
}
@font-face {
  font-family: "Fallback for Merriweather";
  src: local("Georgia");
  size-adjust: 106%;
  ascent-override: 90.4%;
  descent-override: 27.3%;
}

font-family: Merriweather, "Fallback for Merriweather", serif;
```

After a month, the CLS metric improved toÂ 0:

![Core Web Vitals scores for vincent.bernat.ch showing all 6 metrics as green.
Notably the Cumulative Layout Shift is 0.]([[!!images/core-web-vitals.svg]]
"Recent Core Web Vitals scores for vincent.bernat.ch")

# About custom fonts

Using [safe web fonts][] or a [modern font stack][] is often simpler. However, I
prefer custom web fonts. [Merriweather][] and [Iosevka][], which are used in
this blog, enhance the reading experience. An alternative approach could be to
use *Georgia* as a serif option. Unfortunately, most default monospace fonts are
ugly.

Furthermore, paragraphs that combine proportional and monospace fonts can create
visual disruption. This occurs due to mismatched vertical metrics or weights. To
address this issue, I [adjust Iosevka's metrics][] and weight to align with
Merriweather's characteristics.
