  Genie Parser allows one to parse the output of many commands
  into structured data. Here is my short feedback about it.

[Cisco pyATS][] is a framework for network automation and testing. It
includes, among other things, an open-source multi-vendor set of
parsers and models, [Genie Parser][]. It features 2700 parsers for
various commands over many network OS. On the paper, this seems a
great tool!

    ::pycon
    >>> from genie.conf.base import Device
    >>> device = Device("router", os="iosxr")
    >>> # Hack to parse outputs without connecting to a device
    >>> device.custom.setdefault("abstraction", {})["order"] = ["os", "platform"]
    >>> cmd = "show route ipv4 unicast"
    >>> output = """
    ... Tue Oct 29 21:29:10.924 UTC
    ...
    ... O    10.13.110.0/24 [110/2] via 10.12.110.1, 5d23h, GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0.110
    ... """
    >>> device.parse(cmd, output=output)
    {'vrf': {'default': {'address_family': {'ipv4': {'routes': {'10.13.110.0/24': {'route': '10.13.110.0/24',
           'active': True,
           'route_preference': 110,
           'metric': 2,
           'source_protocol': 'ospf',
           'source_protocol_codes': 'O',
           'next_hop': {'next_hop_list': {1: {'index': 1,
              'next_hop': '10.12.110.1',
              'outgoing_interface': 'GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0.110',
              'updated': '5d23h'}}}}}}}}}}

First deception: *pyATS* is closed-source with some exceptions. This
is quite annoying if you run into some issues outside *Genie Parser*.
For example, although *pyATS* is using the `ssh` command, it cannot
leverage my `ssh_config` file: *pyATS* [resolves hostnames before
providing them to `ssh`][#125]. There is [no plan to open source
*pyATS*][pyats opensource]. ðŸ¤¨

Then, *Genie Parser* has two problems:

1. The data models used are dependent on the vendor and OS,
   <del>despite the [documentation][Genie] saying otherwise</del>. For
   example, the data model used for IPv4 interfaces is different
   between [NX-OS][] and [IOS-XR][].
2. The parsers rely on line-by-line regular expressions to extract
   data and some Python code as glue. This is fragile and may break
   silently.

To illustrate the second point, let's assume the output of `show ipv4
vrf all interface` is:

      Loopback10 is Up, ipv4 protocol is Up
        Vrf is default (vrfid 0x60000000)
        Internet protocol processing disabled
      Loopback30 is Up, ipv4 protocol is Down [VRF in FWD reference]
        Vrf is ran (vrfid 0x0)
        Internet address is 203.0.113.17/32
        MTU is 1500 (1500 is available to IP)
        Helper address is not set
        Directed broadcast forwarding is disabled
        Outgoing access list is not set
        Inbound  common access list is not set, access list is not set
        Proxy ARP is disabled
        ICMP redirects are never sent
        ICMP unreachables are always sent
        ICMP mask replies are never sent
        Table Id is 0x0

Because the [regular expression to parse an interface name][] does not
expect the extra data after the interface state, *Genie Parser*
ignores the line starting the definition of `Loopback30` and parses
the output to this structure:[^model]

    ::json
    {
      "Loopback10": {
        "int_status": "up",
        "oper_status": "up",
        "vrf": "ran",
        "vrf_id": "0x0",
        "ipv4": {
          "203.0.113.17/32": {
            "ip": "203.0.113.17",
            "prefix_length": "32"
          },
          "mtu": 1500,
          "mtu_available": 1500,
          "broadcast_forwarding": "disabled",
          "proxy_arp": "disabled",
          "icmp_redirects": "never sent",
          "icmp_unreachables": "always sent",
          "icmp_replies": "never sent",
          "table_id": "0x0"
        }
      }
    }

[^model]: As an exercise, the astute reader is asked to write the code
    to extract the IPv4 from this structure.

While this bug is simple to fix, this is an uphill battle. Any
existing or future slight variation in the output of a command could
trigger another similar undetected bug, despite the extended test
coverage. I have reported and fixed several other silent parsing
errors: [#516][], [#529][], and [#530][]. A more robust alternative
would have been to use [TextFSM][] and to trigger a warning when some
output is not recognized, like [Batfish][], a configuration analysis
tool, does.

In the future, we should rely on [YANG][] for data extraction, but it
is currently not widely supported. SNMP is still a valid possibility
but much information is not accessible through this protocol. In the
meantime, I would advise you to only use *Genie Parser* with caution.
