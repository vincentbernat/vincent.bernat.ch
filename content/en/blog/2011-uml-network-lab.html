To setup a virtual network lab, you get a lot of alternatives. You can
for example use [GNS3][gns3], [Netkit][netkit], [Marionnet][marionnet]
or [VNUML][vnuml]. Some of those tools, like [GNS3][gns3], allow you to
add some closed source equipments like a Cisco 7200 or a Juniper
router.

All those tools are a great way to setup your network lab. *Look at
them!* If you want to setup a virtual network lab for educational
purpose, one of those should fit your purpose. However, none of those
solution were a perfect match for me. I did not want to maintain some
root filesystem. I wanted my lab to start in a few seconds. I wanted
to keep all configuration files (including the ones for the virtual
hosts) into one subdirectory of my home and be able to modify them
while the lab was running. I also wanted to be able to plug some Cisco
router using [Dynamips/Dynagen][dynagen].

None of the listed solution above matched all those
criteria. Therefore, I setup my own lab script with
[User Mode Linux][uml]. This is not a complete solution, but is more
like a home-made solution to match one particular need. You cannot use
the final result without tweaking it. Again, look at the other
solutions first.

We will go step by step to understand how the lab was built. If you
are in a hurry, you can look at the result which is published on
[GitHub][networklab].

# User Mode Linux

[User Mode Linux][uml] (or UML) is a Linux kernel running as a process
instead of running on top of some processor. With Debian, you can
install it using `apt-get install user-mode-linux`. You get a `linux`
command that will run your Linux kernel as a simple process. No need
to be root.

    Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(98,0)

You get a Linux kernel that will just panic because it does not find a
disk to mount to run `init` from it. Usually, you build some root file
system and give it as an argument to your UML kernel.

## Basic setup

However, you can also use your host filesystem as a root
filesystem. We also specify `/bin/sh` as `init` instead of
`/sbin/init`. This will be the first process to be started by our UML
kernel.

    ::console
    $ linux init=/bin/sh rootfstype=hostfs
    [...]
    Linux version 2.6.32 (2.6.32) (root@tito) (gcc version 4.4.5 (Debian 4.4.5-10) ) #2 Thu Jan 27 12:49:46 UTC 2011
    [...]

    Linux (none) 2.6.32 #2 Thu Jan 27 12:49:46 UTC 2011 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    # echo $$
    1

You may want to setup a bit your environment:

    ::console
    # hostname -b R1
    # export TERM=xterm
    # export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin
    # mount -t proc proc /proc
    # mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys
    # mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /var/run -o rw,nosuid,nodev
    # mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /var/log -o rw,nosuid,nodev
    # mount -o bind /usr/lib/uml/modules /lib/modules
    # mount -t hostfs hostfs /home/bernat/mylab -o /home/bernat/mylab

We setup `/proc` and `/sys` correctly. We also turn `/var/run` and
`/var/log` as `tmpfs` filesystems. This will allow most daemons to run
correctly: they will be able to write runtime data in `/var/run` and
to write logs in `/var/log`. You can even launch your favorite syslog
daemon.

The line about `/lib/modules` is to ensure that our UML kernel is able
to access its kernel modules. For example, we can now use
`modprobe tun`. The line about `/home` allows us to mount the home
directory of your host inside UML. This was already the case, but
it was mounted as read-only.

One important thing to notice is that while you seem to be root inside
UML, you did not run `linux` as root. Therefore, when the UML kernel
tries to write a file it will still be bound by the permissions
granted by your host kernel. See this example:

    ::console
    # mount -o remount,rw /
    # touch /tmp/test1
    # touch /etc/test1
    touch: cannot touch `/etc/test1': Permission denied

This is a great way to ensure that your lab will not destroy your
host. Do not run `linux` as root.

What is interesting with such a setup is that you share the filesystem
with your host. You can modify some configuration file on your host
and your UML will see the modification right away. You can also modify
a file inside UML and see the modification on your host too.

## Console & job control

There is a slight problem with this environment. You may be used to it
if you already started your own GNU/Linux system with
`init=/bin/sh`. The problem is that you don't have job control. Job
control allows you to put tasks in background and interrupt them while
they are running. It is job control that allows you to stop a program
with `^C`. Here, you don't have job control. See:

    ::console
    # cat
    ^C^C^C^C

You are stuck. The only way to go out is to kill the `linux` process
on your host.

Job control is a great mystery for me. I don't know how to enable it
by hand. However, `getty` is able to enable job control for you. Just
type this command:

    ::console
    # exec getty -n -l /bin/sh 38400 /dev/tty0

You get job control. We keep `/bin/sh`, but you may prefer `/bin/bash`
since on most systems, `/bin/sh` is rather basic.

## Writable root filesystem

Let's get back to our root filesystem. Most daemons can run just fine
with our setup. For example, we can start [Nginx][nginx], a popular
web server:

    ::console
    # mkdir /var/log/nginx
    # /etc/init.d/nginx start
    Starting nginx: nginx.

However, it will use the configuration file in
`/etc/nginx`. You don't want to modify this directory for all your
labs. The best way to handle this is to start Nginx with a custom
configuration file:

    ::console
    # /etc/init.d/nginx stop
    # nginx -c /home/bernat/mylab/nginx.conf

While keeping the configuration files related to your lab in your home
is an important objective (all your lab related files are in the same
place and you can modify them at will), it may be more convenient to
still use `/etc/init.d/nginx` script to control Nginx. Moreover, some
daemons do not allow you to specify a configuration file. You will then
need to modify your root filesystem.

This is a pretty common problem with [Live CD][livecd] and it is
solved by using an union mount. This is a special kind of mount that
will merge two filesystems into one. One of the two filesystems can be
read-only and all the changes will be reported to the second
one. We will use [AUFS][aufs]. Ensure that you have `aufs-tools`
package installed. Let's start from scratch for this example.

    ::console
    $ linux init=/bin/sh rootfstype=hostfs
    [...]
    # mount -n -t proc proc /proc
    # mount -n -t sysfs sysfs /sys
    # mount -o bind /usr/lib/uml/modules /lib/modules
    # mount -n -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp -o rw,nosuid,nodev
    # mkdir /tmp/ro /tmp/rw /tmp/aufs
    # mount -n -t hostfs hostfs /tmp/ro -o /,ro
    # mount -n -t aufs aufs /tmp/aufs -o noatime,dirs=/tmp/rw:/tmp/ro=ro
    # exec chroot /tmp/aufs /bin/bash

It seems that AUFS with hostfs is rather fragile. We could have merged
our root filesystem with some directory in our lab using `hostfs` like
this:

    ::console
    # mount -n -t hostfs hostfs /tmp/rw -o /home/bernat/mylab/root,rw
    # mount -n -t hostfs hostfs /tmp/ro -o /,ro
    # mount -n -t aufs aufs /tmp/aufs -o noatime,dirs=/tmp/rw:/tmp/ro=ro
    # exec chroot /tmp/aufs /bin/bash

However, the kernel panics on most operations. Therefore, `/tmp/rw` stays
in a `tmpfs` filesystem. This means that any change to the root
filesystem will be lost. I also was unable to issue a correct
`pivot_root` before `chroot`. This is not really important here.

**UPDATED:** It seems that there are other drawbacks to this
setup. For some reason, if you have a separate `/usr` partition on
your host system, you won't be able to write to it until you specify
the `noxino` option to AUFS. Another issue is that AUFS does not
notice most changes on the hostfs filesystem. You can fix this with
option `udba=inotify`. However, this is incompatible with the `noxino`
option. Therefore, you need to choose what is best for your
lab. You can also mount some parts of your home with `hostfs` (for
example, the source directory of the piece of software that you would
like to test).

Let's consider that Nginx configuration is in
`/home/bernat/lab/nginx`. We simply uses a symbolic link:

    ::console
    # rm -rf /etc/nginx
    # ln -s /home/bernat/mylab/nginx /etc/nginx

Since we lose the modifications to the root filesystem, the symbolic
link should be done each time we start the lab. However, we can modify
directly the configuration files in the host or in the UML.

# Networking

We know how to start our UML. Let's see how we can add some wires to
it. UML supports several network adapters. The two most useful are TAP
and VDE backend.

## TAP

A [TAP interface][tap] is a virtual network kernel device which can be
used by userland applications to inject layer 2 frames in
it. If the kernel sends frames in a TAP device, they will be received
by the application listening to it. This also works the other way
around. A TAP interface is a regular ethernet device for the
kernel. This means that you can bridge it or use `tcpdump` on it.

The drawback of such interfaces is that you need to be root to create
them. The application using them does not need to be run as root.

I usually use this nifty shell function to setup TAP interfaces:

    ::sh
    __add_to_bridge() {
        # Optionally, add it to given bridge
        [ -z "$2" ] || {
            [ -f /sys/class/net/$2/brforward ] || {
                sudo brctl addbr $2
                sudo brctl stp $2 off
                sudo ip link set $2 up
            }
            [ -f /sys/class/net/$2/brif/$1 ] || {
                # We need to check if it is in another bridge
                bridge=$(echo /sys/class/net/*/brif/$1 2> /dev/null | \
                    sed 's+/sys/class/net/\([^/]*\)/.*+\1+') 2> /dev/null
                [ -n "$bridge" ] && \
                    sudo brctl delif $bridge $1
                sudo brctl addif $2 $1
            }
        }
    }
    tap() {
        sudo tunctl -b -u $(whoami) -t $1 > /dev/null
        sudo ip link set up dev $1
        __add_to_bridge $1 $2
    }

It will create the interface and put it into a bridge. For example,
you can create two interfaces linked together through a bridge to
allow two UML to talk each other:

    ::console
    $ tap tap-R1 br-R1R2
    $ tap tap-R2 br-R1R2

We can setup two UML which will use those interfaces. The first one is
setup like this:

    ::console
    $ linux init=/bin/sh rootfstype=hostfs eth0=tuntap,tap-R1
    [...]
    # ip link set up dev eth0
    # ip addr add 192.168.0.1/24 dev eth0

The second one:

    ::console
    $ linux init=/bin/sh rootfstype=hostfs eth0=tuntap,tap-R2
    [...]
    # ip link set up dev eth0
    # ip addr add 192.168.0.2/24 dev eth0
    # ping 192.168.0.1
    PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
    Warning: time of day goes back (-13832us), taking countermeasures.
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=20 ttl=64 time=0.633 ms
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=21 ttl=64 time=0.157 ms

If you are running a firewall on your host, ensure that you let your
host forward those packets. By default, bridging code forwards the
frames through Netfilter.

## VDE

A [VDE][vde] switch is a software emulation of a regular network
switch. It is a userland component and does not need to be run as
root. You need to install `vde2` package to make use of it. You can
run a switch using `vde_switch` command. You will get a console by
pressing _Enter_. From this console, you can configure the switch: add
ports, configure VLAN, etc.

Like for TAP interfaces, let's setup two UML connected to this
switch. The first one is like this:

    ::console
    $ linux init=/bin/sh rootfstype=hostfs eth0=vde
    [...]
    # ip link set up dev eth0
    # ip addr add 192.168.0.1/24 dev eth0

And the second one:

    ::console
    $ linux init=/bin/sh rootfstype=hostfs eth0=vde
    [...]
    # ip link set up dev eth0
    # ip addr add 192.168.0.2/24 dev eth0
    # ping 192.168.0.1
    PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=2.93 ms
    Warning: time of day goes back (-8101us), taking countermeasures.
    64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0.503 ms

# The lab

So far, we had a look at what can be used to setup a lab. We need to
put everything together into some script to setup the lab in a quick
way. For each lab that I want to setup, I copy my latest script to a
new location and adapt to the topology I want. I have put everything
described below in [GitHub][networklab]. Feel free to browse and fork.

Our lab will be about setting up a redundant VPN between two remote
sites of the same company. This company is using OSPF as an IGP on
each site and we will use BGP to let each site know the routes
advertised in the other site. We will only use VDE switches for the
layer 2 part.

![Redundant VPN lab][1]
[1]: [[!!images/uml-lab.png]] "Topology of redundant VPN lab"

Let's implement this lab. You should grab the sources first:

    ::console
    $ git clone https://github.com/vincentbernat/network-lab.git
    $ cd network-lab/lab-redundant-vpn

You have a `setup` script which will setup the whole lab for you. You
also have one directory for each UML. Those directories only contain
configuration for the various daemons used inside UML. To make this
lab work, ensure that you have `quagga` ([Quagga][quagga], an Internet
routing daemon supporting both OSPF and BGP) and `racoon` packages.

## UML configuration

First look at the end of script. There is something like this:

    ::sh
    case $$ in
        1)
            # Inside UML. Three states:
            [...]
            ;;
        *)
            TMP=$(mktemp -d)
            trap "rm -rf $TMP" EXIT
            check_dependencies
            setup_screen
            # Setup switches
            setup_switch site1
            setup_switch site101
            setup_switch internet
            # Start VM
            start_vm R1 eth0=vde,$TMP/switch-site1.sock
            start_vm R2 eth0=vde,$TMP/switch-site101.sock
            start_vm V1 eth0=vde,$TMP/switch-site1.sock eth1=vde,$TMP/switch-internet.sock
            start_vm V2 eth0=vde,$TMP/switch-site1.sock eth1=vde,$TMP/switch-internet.sock
            start_vm V3 eth0=vde,$TMP/switch-site101.sock eth1=vde,$TMP/switch-internet.sock
            start_vm V4 eth0=vde,$TMP/switch-site101.sock eth1=vde,$TMP/switch-internet.sock
            start_vm I1 eth0=vde,$TMP/switch-internet.sock
            display_help
            cleanup
            screen -X quit
            ;;
    esac

The script will check its PID (`$$`). If it is 1, this means it has
been invoked as `init`. Otherwise, it means it has been launched by
the user. We will see the `init` part later. When called, we first
check some dependencies, then we setup `screen`. Everything is run
inside a screen session. No multiple windows. The next step is to
setup the various switches needed for our lab. We take one switch for
each site and one switch for "Internet". The function that setups the
switch just invokes `vde_switch` with the help of `start-stop-daemon`
to record the PID (to shutdown the lab properly).

Then, we start our various UML. For each of them, we need to specify
which network adapters we need. For _R1_ and _R2_, we don't use a
network adapter to connect to the internal network. We will use a
`dummy0` interface. To emulate Internet, we use another UML,
_I1_.

For each UML, our script will be used as `init`. In this case, its PID
will be 1. As we have seen earlier, the script checks if it is called
as `init`. If it is the case, it will setup the UML. During this
setup, host specific configuration will be applied:

    ::sh
    echo "[+] Setup UML"
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    case ${uts} in
        R1)
            modprobe dummy
            ip link set up dev dummy0
            ip addr add 192.168.15.1/24 dev dummy0
            ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0
            setup_quagga
            ;;
        R2)
            modprobe dummy
            ip link set up dev dummy0
            ip addr add 192.168.115.1/24 dev dummy0
            ip addr add 192.168.101.10/24 dev eth0
            setup_quagga
            ;;
        V1)
            ip addr add 192.168.1.11/24 dev eth0
            ip addr add 1.1.2.1/24 dev eth1
            ip route add default via 1.1.2.10
            setup_quagga
            setup_racoon 1.1.2.1 1.1.1.1 192.168.0.0/19-192.168.100.0/19
            ;;
        V2)
            ip addr add 192.168.1.12/24 dev eth0
            ip addr add 1.1.2.2/24 dev eth1
            ip route add default via 1.1.2.10
            setup_quagga
            setup_racoon 1.1.2.2 1.1.1.2 192.168.0.0/19-192.168.100.0/19
            ;;
        V3)
            ip addr add 192.168.101.13/24 dev eth0
            ip addr add 1.1.1.1/24 dev eth1
            ip route add default via 1.1.1.10
            setup_quagga
            setup_racoon 1.1.1.1 1.1.2.1 192.168.100.0/19-192.168.0.0/19
            ;;
        V4)
            ip addr add 192.168.101.14/24 dev eth0
            ip addr add 1.1.1.2/24 dev eth1
            ip route add default via 1.1.1.10
            setup_quagga
            setup_racoon 1.1.1.2 1.1.2.2 192.168.100.0/19-192.168.0.0/19
            ;;
        I1)
            ip addr add 1.1.1.10/24 dev eth0
            ip addr add 1.1.2.10/24 dev eth0
            ;;
    esac

After all this, we drop to a shell to allow you to issue additional
commands interactively.

## Testing

We need to wait one minute after the lab has been started. We can then
check the routing table of various equipments. For example, here is
_R1_ routing table (you need to type `vtysh` to get Quagga console):

    ::console
    R1# show ip route
    Codes: K - kernel route, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, O - OSPF,
           I - ISIS, B - BGP, > - selected route, * - FIB route

    C>* 127.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, lo
    O   192.168.1.0/24 [110/10] is directly connected, eth0, 00:25:42
    C>* 192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, eth0
    O   192.168.15.0/24 [110/10] is directly connected, dummy0, 00:25:42
    C>* 192.168.15.0/24 is directly connected, dummy0
    O>* 192.168.115.0/24 [110/20] via 192.168.1.11, eth0, 00:02:24
      *                           via 192.168.1.12, eth0, 00:02:24

We can see that if this router wants to contact _R2_, it has learned a
multipath route with OSPF and can then sends its packets through _V1_
or _V2_, as expected. Here is the routing table of _V3_:

    ::console

We see that to contact _R1_, _V3_ knows two routes. One with BGP
through the VPN. This is the one that will be used. The other one is
through _V4_ but will not be used unless the BGP route is lost.

We can ping _R2_ from _R1_:

    ::console
    R1# ping -I 192.168.15.1 192.168.115.1
    PING 192.168.115.1 (192.168.115.1) from 192.168.15.1 : 56(84) bytes of data.
    Warning: time of day goes back (-459129us), taking countermeasures.
    64 bytes from 192.168.115.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=62 time=1.10 ms

Let's suppose we break the link between _V1_ and the "Internet" (using
`ip link set down eth1` on _V1_). The previous multipath route on _R1_
is now a single route through _V2_. Moreover, _V3_ has lost its BGP
route to _V1_ and is now using its OSPF route through _V4_:

    ::console
    V3# show ip route
    Codes: K - kernel route, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, O - OSPF,
           I - ISIS, B - BGP, > - selected route, * - FIB route

    K>* 0.0.0.0/0 via 1.1.1.10, eth1
    C>* 1.1.1.0/24 is directly connected, eth1
    C>* 127.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, lo
    O>* 192.168.15.0/24 [110/20] via 192.168.101.14, eth0, 00:10:13
    O   192.168.101.0/24 [110/10] is directly connected, eth0, 00:13:17
    C>* 192.168.101.0/24 is directly connected, eth0
    O>* 192.168.115.0/24 [110/20] via 192.168.101.10, eth0, 00:13:05

We could enhance the resiliance of such a setup by adding a dedicated
link between _V1_ and _V2_ and between _V3_ and _V4_ and running OSPF
on this link (or iBGP). This would allow us to support several outages
on our network.

# Conclusion

The script used to setup this lab can be adapted to setup other labs
with little effort. Please, note that it depends on the configuration
of your environment. However, the whole lab is contained in a single
directory and is very small. You can email it to your friends or
publish it on [GitHub][networklab].

It can also be extended to support [Dynagen][dynagen] to include some
Cisco equipments in your lab (for example, to experiment with VRF or
MPLS).
