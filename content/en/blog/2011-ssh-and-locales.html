On my system, I happen to set `LANG` to `fr_FR.utf8` and `LC_MESSAGES`
to `en_US.utf8`. This means that applications should follow French
cultural conventions for most things except for messages which should
be displayed in US English. On my own system, `/etc/locale.gen`
contains those two locales. However, when I connect to some random
remote system, they may be unavailable. Most applications will
fallback silently to `C`. However, Perl can be quite noisy:

    ::console
    $ perl -e 'print "Hello\n";'
    perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
    perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
            LANGUAGE = (unset),
            LC_ALL = (unset),
            LC_MESSAGES = "en_US.utf8",
            LANG = "fr_FR.utf8"
        are supported and installed on your system.
    perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
    Hello

This is an incredibly annoying message. I don't understand why we
still need to [bear it][221790]. [Perl documentation][perllocale] explains how
to get rid of this message. The simplest way is to set `PERL_BADLANG`
environment variable to 0. Problem solved.

    ::console
    $ PERL_BADLANG=0 perl -e 'print "Hello\n";'
    Hello

Well, no. Keep reading. When you connect to a remote host with `ssh`,
all your environment variables are thrown away, except those defined
in `AcceptEnv` directive in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the remote
host. On Debian, this directive defaults to `LANG LC_*`. This means
that `PERL_BADLANG` will not be transmitted on the remote system. Back
to square one.

Since I cannot install my favourite locales on all hosts or fiddle
environment variables on them, I use something like this in my
`.zshrc`:

    ::bash
    ssh() {
      [ -t 1 ] && echo -ne "\033]0;$@\007"
      LANG=C LC_MESSAGES=C =ssh "$@"
    }

Unfortunately, on systems where my locales are present, I still
fallback to the crappy `C` locale. I could just unset `LANG` and
`LC_MESSAGES` to allow fallback to the proper default locale but if
the remote system starts to speak Spanish, I will not be
pleased. Moreover, the behaviour of `C` locale (also known as `POSIX`
locale) is undefined with characters not in the portable character
set. From [IEEE Std 1003.1][locales]:

> Conforming systems shall provide a POSIX locale, also known as the C
> locale. The behavior of standard utilities and functions in the POSIX
> locale shall be as if the locale was defined via the `localedef` utility
> with input data from the POSIX locale tables in [Locale Definition][1].
> 
> The tables in [Locale Definition][1] describe the characteristics and
> behavior of the POSIX locale for data consisting entirely of
> characters from the portable character set and the control character
> set. For other characters, the behavior is unspecified. For C-language

> 
> The POSIX locale can be specified by assigning to the appropriate

There is no way to detect the locales installed on the remote system
unless you connect to it. Starting a connection just to check the
locale is too expensive.

On my own systems, I use another snippet in `.zshrc` to reconfigure
the locales to my favourite ones if they are available:

    ::bash
    export LANG=C
    export LC_MESSAGES=C
    (( $+commands[locale] )) && function {
        local locales
        locales=( "LANG fr_FR.utf8 en_US.utf8 C.UTF-8 C" \
                  "LC_MESSAGES en_US.utf8 fr_FR.utf8 C.UTF-8 C" )
        for locale in $locales; do
            for l in $=locale[(w)2,-1]; do
                if locale -a | grep -qx $l; then
                    export $locale[(w)1]=$l
                    break
                fi
            done
        done
    } 2> /dev/null

This is an interesting snippet which uses some ZSH features.

 - The use of `(( $+commands[locale] ))` is a way to check if the
   `locale` command exists. Briefer than `if $(which locale >&
   /dev/null)`
 - The use of an [anonymous function][zsh] to avoid to clutter the
   global environment with local variables.
 - The use of word splitting. `$locale[(w)1]` converts `$locale` to an
   array and pops the first item. `$=locale[(w)2,-1]` converts
   `$locale` to an array, keeps the tail and apply word splitting to
   it (by default, zsh does not automatically apply word splitting to
   non quoted variables).

Feel free to tell me if you have found a better way to handle this problem!
