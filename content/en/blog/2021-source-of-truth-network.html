  NetBox is often the go-to solution for a source of truth when
  automating the network. Using Git instead brings several perks. ðŸŽƒ

The first step when automating a network is to build the **source of
truth**. A source of truth is a repository of data that provides the
intended state: the list of devices, the IP addresses, the network
protocols settings, the time servers, etc. A popular choice is
[NetBox][]. Its documentation highlights its usage as a source of
truth:

> *NetBox* intends to represent the desired state of a network versus
> its operational state. As such, automated import of live network
> state is strongly discouraged. All data created in *NetBox* should
> first be vetted by a human to ensure its integrity. *NetBox* can
> then be used to populate monitoring and provisioning systems with a
> high degree of confidence.

When introducing [Jerikan][], a common feedback we got was: "you
should use *NetBox* for this." Indeed, *Jerikan*'s source of truth is
a [bunch of YAML files][] versioned with *Git*.

# Why Git?

If we look at how things are done with servers and services, in a
datacenter or in the cloud, we are likely to find users of
[Terraform][], a tool turning declarative configuration files into
infrastructure. Declarative configuration management tools like
[Salt][], [Puppet][],[^wikimedia] or [Ansible][] take care of server
configuration. [NixOS][] is an alternative: it combines package
management and configuration management with a functional language to
build virtual machines and containers. When using a Kubernetes
cluster, people use [Kustomize][] or [Helm][], two other declarative
configuration management tools. Tapped together, these tools implement
the *infrastructure as code* paradigm.

[^wikimedia]: Wikimedia manages its infrastructure with *Puppet*. They
    publish everything on [GitHub][wikimedia]. Creative Commons uses
    *Salt*. They also publish everything on [GitHub][creativecommons].
    Thanks to them for doing that! I wish I could provide more
    real-life examples.

A version control system is a central tool for infrastructure as code.
The usual candidate is *Git* with a source code management system like
[GitLab][] or [GitHub][]. You get:

Traceability and visibility
: *Git* keeps a log of all changes: what, who, why, and when. With a
  bit of discipline, each change is explained and self-contained. It
  becomes part of the infrastructure documentation. When the support
  team complains about a degraded experience for some customers over
  the last two months or so, you quickly discover this may be related
  to a change to an incoming policy in New York.

Rolling back
: If a change is defective, it can be reverted quickly, safely, and
  without much effort, even if other changes happened in the meantime.
  The policy change at the origin of the problem spanned over three
  routers. Reverting this specific change and deploying the
  configuration let you solve the situation until you find a better
  fix.

Branching, reviewing, merging
: When working on a new feature or refactoring some part of the
  infrastructure, a team member creates a branch and works on their
  change without interfering with the work of other members. Once the
  branch is ready, a pull request is created and the change is ready
  to be reviewed by the other team members before merging. You
  discover the issue was related to diverting traffic through an IX
  where one ISP was connected without enough capacity. You propose and
  discuss a fix that includes a change of the schema and the templates
  used to declare policies to be able to handle this case.

Continuous integration
: For each change, automated tests are triggered. They can detect
  problems and give more details on the effect of a change. Branches
  can be deployed to a test infrastructure where regression tests are
  executed. The results can be synthesized as a comment in the pull
  request to help the review. You check your proposed change does not
  modify the other existing policies.

# Why not NetBox?

*NetBox* does not share these features. It is a database with a REST
and a GraphQL API. Traceability is limited: changes are not grouped
into a transaction and they are not documented. You cannot fork the
database. Usually, there is one staging database to test modifications
before applying them to the production database. It does not scale
well and reviews are difficult. Applying the same change to the
production database can be hazardous. Rolling back a change is
non-trivial.

!!! "Update (2021-11)" [Nautobot][], a fork of *NetBox*, will soon
address this point by using [Dolt][], a SQL database engine allowing
you to clone, branch, and merge, like a *Git* repository. *Dolt* is
compatible with *MySQL* clients. See "[Nautobots, Roll Back!][]" for a
preview of this feature.

Moreover, *NetBox* is not usually the single source of truth. It
contains your hardware inventory, the IP addresses, and some topology
information. However, this is not the place you put authorized SSH
keys, syslog servers, or the BGP configuration. If you also use
[Ansible][], this information ends in its inventory. The source of
truth is therefore fragmented between several tools with different
workflows. Since *NetBox* 2.7, you can append additional data with
[configuration contexts][]. This mitigates this point. The data is
arranged hierarchically but the hierarchy cannot be
customized.[^custom] *Nautobot* can manage configuration contexts in
a *Git* repository, while still allowing to use of the API to fetch
them. You get some additional perks, thanks to *Git*, but the
remaining data is still in a database with a different lifecycle.

[^custom]: Being able to customize the hierarchy is key to avoiding
    repetition in the data. For example, if switches are paired
    together, some data should be attached to them as a group and not
    duplicated on each of them. Tags can be used to partially work
    around this issue but you lose the hierarchical aspect.

Lastly, the schema used by *NetBox* may not fit your needs and you
cannot tweak it. For example, you may have a rule to compute the IPv6
address from the IPv4 address for dual-stack interfaces. Such a
relationship cannot be easily expressed and enforced in *NetBox*. When
changing the IPv4 address, you may forget the IPv6 address. The source
of truth should only contain the IPv4 address but you also want the
IPv6 address in *NetBox* because this is your IPAM and you need it to
update your DNS entries.

# Why not Git?

There are some limitations when putting your source of truth in *Git*:

1. If you want to expose a web interface to allow an external team to
   request a change, it is more difficult to do it with *Git* than
   with a database. Out-of-the-box, *NetBox* provides a nice web
   interface and a permission system. You can also write your own web
   interface and interact with *NetBox* through its API.
2. YAML files are more difficult to query in different ways. For
   example, looking for a free IP address is complex if they are
   scattered in multiple places.

In my opinion, in most cases, you are better off putting the source of
truth in *Git* instead of *NetBox*. You get a lot of perks by doing
that and you can still use *NetBox* as a read-only view, usable by
other tools. We do that with an [Ansible module][]. In the remaining
cases, *Git* could still fit the bill. Read-only access control can be
done through submodules. Pull requests can restrict write access: a
bot can check the changes only modify allowed files before
auto-merging. This still requires some *Git* knowledge, but many teams
are now comfortable using *Git*, thanks to its ubiquity.
