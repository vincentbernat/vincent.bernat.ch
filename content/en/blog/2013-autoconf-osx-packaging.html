There are three main ways to distribute a command-line daemon for
macOS:

 1. Distributing source code and instructions on how to compile it.
 2. Using a third-party package manager, like [Homebrew][].
 3. Providing an [installer package][].

[TOC]

# Homebrew

[Homebrew][] is a popular package management system. It works like the
BSDs' ports collections by downloading, compiling and installing the
requested software, while also installing any required dependencies
automatically. Creating a new package is quite easy and there are a
[lot of examples available][].

However, there are some limitations:

 - You don't really build a package but execute a recipe to locally
   install the software.
 - You need to install development tools, either a whole [Xcode][]
   installation[^creditcard] or the command line version.
 - If you need to execute some steps as _root_, you will have to
   explain them to the user for them to execute by hand. This includes
   the creation of a system user or the installation of a daemon
   through `launchd`.

[^creditcard]: Even if _Xcode_ is free, you will need to register to
               Apple and show a valid credit card number. That's quite
               an interesting requirement.

If you can't live with these limitations, you may need to build an
installer package.

# Building an installer package

macOS comes with a graphical and a command-line installer. The
graphical one is run by opening a package from the [Finder][]. Then,
the user experiences some familiar wizard allowing them to install the
software in a matter of a few seconds.

![macOS graphical installer][osx-installer]
[osx-installer]: [[!!images/osx-installer.png]] "Example of macOS graphical installer"

The documentation around how to build such a package is somewhat
clumsy. You may find outdated information or pieces of information
that only apply to projects using _Xcode_. I will try to provide here
accurate bits in the following context:

 1. You are packaging a pure **command-line tool**.
 2. You are using [Autoconf][] and [Automake][] as a build system.
 3. You want to support **several architectures**.
 4. You want to support **older versions of macOS**.

## Creating a package

Building such a package was previously done with some graphical tool
called _PackageMaker_. This tool is not available any more and
developers are asked to switch to [pkgbuild][] and
[productbuild][]. There is a very neat [Stackoverflow article][] on
how these tools work.

A package is built in two steps:

 1. Build **component packages**.
 2. Combine them into a **product archive**.

A _component package_ contains a set of files and a set of scripts to
execute at various steps of the installation. You can have several
component packages, for example a package for the daemon and a package
for the client. They are built with `pkgbuild`.

A _product archive_ contains the previously created component packages
as well as a file describing various options of the installer
(required and optional components, license, welcome text, ...).

To create a component package, we need to install the needed files in
some directory:

    ::console
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/private/etc
    $ make
    $ make install DESTDIR=$PWD/osx-pkg

We will now put the content of `osx-pkg` into a component package with
`pkgbuild`:

    ::console
    $ mkdir pkg1
    $ pkgbuild --root osx-pkg \
    >    --identifier org.someid.daemon \
    >    --version 0.47 \
    >    --ownership recommended \
    >    pkg1/output.pkg
    pkgbuild: Inferring bundle components from contents of osx-pkg
    pkgbuild: Wrote package to output.pkg

You need to be careful with the identifier. It needs to be unique and
identify your software as well as the specific component. Then, you
need to create an XML file describing the installer. Let's call it
`distribution.xml`:

    ::xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?>
    <installer-gui-script minSpecVersion="1">
        <title>Some daemon</title>
        <organization>org.someid</organization>
        <domains enable_localSystem="true"/>
        <options customize="never" require-scripts="true" rootVolumeOnly="true" />
        <!-- Define documents displayed at various steps -->
        <welcome    file="welcome.html"    mime-type="text/html" />
        <license    file="license.html"    mime-type="text/html" />
        <conclusion file="conclusion.html" mime-type="text/html" />
        <!-- List all component packages -->
        <pkg-ref id="org.someid.daemon"
                 version="0"
                 auth="root">output.pkg</pkg-ref>
        <!-- List them again here. They can now be organized
             as a hierarchy if you want. -->
        <choices-outline>
            <line choice="org.someid.daemon"/>
        </choices-outline>
        <!-- Define each choice above -->
        <choice
            id="org.someid.daemon"
            visible="false"
            title="some daemon"
            description="The daemon"
            start_selected="true">
          <pkg-ref id="org.someid.daemon"/>
        </choice>
    </installer-gui-script>

Fortunately, this file is
[documented on Apple Developer Library][]. Since we only describe one
package, we pass `customize="never"` as an option to skip the choice
part. You can however remove this attribute when you have several
component packages. The attribute `rootVolumeOnly="true"` explains
that this daemon can only be installed system-wide. It is marked as
deprecated but still works. Its replacement (`domains` tag) displays
an unusual and buggy pane which Apple doesn't use in any of its
packages.

You need to put the HTML[^format] documents into a `resources`
directory. It is also possible to choose the background by specifying
a `<background/>` tag.

[^format]: It is possible to use other formats (like RTF or just plain
           text) for documents but HTML seems the best choice if you
           want some formatting without fiddling with RTF.

The following command will generate the product archive:

    ::console
    $ productbuild --distribution distribution.xml \
    >              --resources resources \
    >              --package-path pkg1 \
    >              --version 0.47 \
    >              ../final.pkg
    productbuild: Wrote product to ../final.pkg

## Scripts

The installer can execute some scripts during installation. For
example, suppose we would like to register our daemon with `launchd`
for it to be run at system start. You first need to write some
`org.someid.plist` file and ensure it will get installed in
`/Library/LaunchDaemons`:

    ::xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
      <key>Label</key>
      <string>org.someid</string>
      <key>ProgramArguments</key>
      <array>
        <string>/usr/sbin/mydaemon</string>
        <string>-d</string>
      </array>
      <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>
      <key>KeepAlive</key><true/>
    </dict>
    </plist>

Then create a `scripts/postinstall` file with the following content:

    ::sh
    #!/bin/sh
    
    set -e
    /bin/launchctl load "/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.someid.plist"

You also need a `scripts/preinstall` file which will allow your
program to be smoothly upgraded:

    ::sh
    #!/bin/bash
    
    set -e
    if /bin/launchctl list "org.someid" &> /dev/null; then
        /bin/launchctl unload "/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.someid.plist"
    fi

Ensure that these scripts are executable and add `--scripts scripts`
to `pkgbuild` invocation.

If you need to add a system user, use [dscl][].

## Dependencies

There is no dependency management built into macOS
installer. Therefore, you should ensure that everything is present in
the package or in the base system. For example, `lldpd` relies on
[libevent][], an event notification library. This library is not
provided with macOS. When it is not found, the build system will use an
embedded copy. However, if you have installed _libevent_ with
_Homebrew_, you will get binaries linked to this local _libevent_
installation. Your package won't work on another host.

The output of `otool -L` can detect unwanted dependencies:

    ::console
    $ otool -L build/usr/sbin/lldpd
    build/usr/sbin/lldpd:
            /usr/lib/libresolv.9.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
            /System/Library/Frameworks/IOKit.framework/Versions/A/IOKit (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 275.0.0)
            /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 744.19.0)
            /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Versions/C/Foundation (compatibility version 300.0.0, current version 945.18.0)
            /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 169.3.0)

## Compilation for older versions of macOS

The package as built above may only work on the same version of macOS
that you use to compile. If you want a package that will work on
Mac OS X 10.6, you will need to download the appropriate SDK.[^sdk]

[^sdk]: Unfortunately, Apple makes it difficult to find them. The
        easiest way to get the SDK for Mac OS X 10.6 is to download
        _Xcode_ 4.3.3, mount the image and copy the SDK to
        `/Developer/SDKs`.

Then, you need to tell the compiler the target version of macOS and the
SDK location. You can do this by setting `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` (and
`CXXFLAGS` if you use C++):

    ::console
    $ SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/private/etc \
    >         CFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -isysroot $SDK" \
    >         LDFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -isysroot $SDK"

The `-mmacosx-version-min` flag will be used by various macros in the
headers to mark some functions as available or not, depending on the
version of macOS you target. It will also be used by the linker.

The `-isysroot` will tell the location of the SDK. Headers and
libraries will be looked up in this location first.

## Universal binaries

Mac OS X 10.6 was available for both IA-32 and x86-64
architectures. If you want to support both installations with a single
package, you need to build [universal binaries][]. The Mach object
file format, used by macOS, allows several versions of the executable
in the same file. The operating system will select the most
appropriate one.

An easy way to generate such files is to pass `-arch i386 -arch
x86_64` to the compiler:

    ::console
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/private/etc \
    >     CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64" \
    >     CPP="gcc -E"

However, this is a dangerous option. Suppose that your `./configure`
script tries to determine some architecture-dependent parameter, like
the size of an integer (with `AC_CHECK_SIZEOF`); it will compute it
for the _host_ architecture. The binary generated for the other
architecture will therefore use a wrong value and may crash at some
point.

The correct way to generate a universal binary is to execute two separate
compilations and to build the universal binary with [lipo][]:

    ::console
    $ for arch in i386 x86_64; do
    >   mkdir $arch ; cd $arch
    >   ../configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/private/etc \
    >       CC="gcc -arch $ARCH" \
    >       CPP="gcc -E"
    >   make
    >   make install DESTDIR=$PWD/../target-$ARCH
    >   cd ..
    > done
    […]
    $ lipo -create -output daemon i386/usr/sbin/daemon x86_64/usr/sbin/daemon

Since `lipo` only works on file, I have written a Python script
[applying `lipo` recursively to several directories][rlipo].

## Putting everything together

Now, we need to automate a bit. You could provide some nifty script. I
propose an appropriate `Makefile.am` instead. This way, we can use the
output variables, like `@VERSION@`, from `./configure` to generate
some of the files, like `distribution.xml`. You need to add that in
your `configure.ac`:

    ::m4
    AC_CONFIG_FILES([osx/Makefile osx/distribution.xml osx/im.bernat.lldpd.plist])
    AC_CONFIG_FILES([osx/scripts/preinstall],  [chmod +x osx/scripts/preinstall])
    AC_CONFIG_FILES([osx/scripts/postinstall], [chmod +x osx/scripts/postinstall])
    AC_SUBST([CONFIGURE_ARGS], [$ac_configure_args])


Let's have a look at [`osx/Makefile.am`][Makefile.am]. First, we
define some variables:

    ::make
    PKG_NAME=@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@.pkg
    PKG_TITLE=@PACKAGE@ @VERSION@
    PKG_DIR=@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
    ARCHS=@host_cpu@

If we want to build for several architectures, we will type `make
ARCHS="x86_64 i386"`. Otherwise it defaults to the current host's
architecture.

We use `install-data-local` target to install files specific to macOS:

    ::make
    install-data-local:
    	install -m 0755 -d $(DESTDIR)/Library/LaunchDaemons
    	install -m 0644 im.bernat.@PACKAGE@.plist $(DESTDIR)/Library/LaunchDaemons
    uninstall-local:
    	rm -f $(DESTDIR)/Library/LaunchDaemons/im.bernat.@PACKAGE@.plist

The main target is the product archive, built with `productbuild`:

    ::make
    ../$(PKG_NAME): pkg.1/$(PKG_NAME) distribution.xml resources
    	$(PRODUCTBUILD) \
    		--distribution distribution.xml \
    		--resources resources \
    		--package-path pkg.1 \
    		--version @VERSION@ \
    		$@

Its main dependency is the component package:

    ::make
    pkg.1/$(PKG_NAME): $(PKG_DIR) scripts
    	[ -d pkg.1 ] || mkdir pkg.1
    	$(PKGBUILD) \
    		--root $(PKG_DIR) \
    		--identifier im.bernat.@PACKAGE@.daemon \
    		--version @VERSION@ \
    		--ownership recommended \
    		--scripts scripts \
    		$@

Now, we need to build `$(PKG_DIR)`:

    ::make
    $(PKG_DIR): stamp-$(PKG_DIR)
    stamp-$(PKG_DIR): $(ARCHS:%=%/$(PKG_DIR))
    	$(srcdir)/lipo $(PKG_DIR) $^
    	touch $@

The `$(ARCHS:%=%/$(PKG_DIR))` will expand to `x86_64/$(PKG_DIR)
i386/$(PKG_DIR)`. This is a [substitution reference][].[^patsubst]

[^patsubst]: This is equivalent to the use of `patsubst`
             function. However, this function is specific to _GNU
             make_. The substitution reference pattern was accepted
             recently in POSIX and is coined as [pattern macro expansion][].

Before applying our `lipo` script, we need to be able to build the
architecture-dependent package directories:

    ::make
    pkg_curarch = $(@:stamp-%=%)
    $(ARCHS:%=%/$(PKG_DIR)): %/$(PKG_DIR): stamp-%
    $(ARCHS:%=stamp-%): stamp-%: im.bernat.lldpd.plist
    	[ -d $(pkg_curarch) ] || mkdir -p $(pkg_curarch)
    	(cd $(pkg_curarch) && \
    		$(abs_top_srcdir)/configure @CONFIGURE_ARGS@ \
    			CC="@CC@ -arch $(pkg_curarch)" \
    			CPP="@CPP@")
    	(cd $(pkg_curarch) && \
    		$(MAKE) install DESTDIR=$(abs_builddir)/$(pkg_curarch)/$(PKG_DIR))
    	touch $@

This may seem a bit obscure, but this is really like what we have
described previously. Note that we use `@CONFIGURE_ARGS@` which is a
variable we have defined in `configure.ac`.

Here is how a user would create its own macOS package:

    ::console
    $ SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ ../configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/private/etc --with-embedded-libevent \
    >   CFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -isysroot $SDK" \
    >   LDFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -isysroot $SDK"
    […]
    $ make -C osx pkg ARCHS="i386 x86_64"
    […]
    productbuild: Wrote product to ../lldpd-0.7.5-21-g5b90c4f-dirty.pkg
    The package has been built in ../lldpd-0.7.5-21-g5b90c4f-dirty.pkg.
