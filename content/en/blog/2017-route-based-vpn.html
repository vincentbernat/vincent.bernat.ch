A common way to establish an IPsec tunnel on Linux is to use an IKE daemon, like
the one from the [strongSwan][] project, with a minimal
configuration:[^libreswan]

    ::properties
    conn V2-1
      left        = 2001:db8:1::1
      leftsubnet  = 2001:db8:a1::/64
      right       = 2001:db8:2::1
      rightsubnet = 2001:db8:a2::/64
      authby      = psk
      auto        = route

[^libreswan]: Everything in this post should work with [Libreswan][].

The same configuration can be used on both sides. Each side will figure out if
it is "left" or "right." The IPsec site-to-site tunnel endpoints are
`2001:db8:­1::1` and `2001:db8:­2::1`. The protected subnets are
`2001:db8:­a1::/64` and `2001:db8:­a2::/64`. As a result, *strongSwan*
configures the following policies in the kernel:

    ::console
    $ ip xfrm policy
    src 2001:db8:a1::/64 dst 2001:db8:a2::/64
            dir out priority 399999 ptype main
            tmpl src 2001:db8:1::1 dst 2001:db8:2::1
                    proto esp reqid 4 mode tunnel
    src 2001:db8:a2::/64 dst 2001:db8:a1::/64
            dir fwd priority 399999 ptype main
            tmpl src 2001:db8:2::1 dst 2001:db8:1::1
                    proto esp reqid 4 mode tunnel
    src 2001:db8:a2::/64 dst 2001:db8:a1::/64
            dir in priority 399999 ptype main
            tmpl src 2001:db8:2::1 dst 2001:db8:1::1
                    proto esp reqid 4 mode tunnel
    […]

This kind of IPsec tunnel is a **policy-based VPN**: encapsulation and
decapsulation are governed by these policies. Each of them contains the
following elements:

 - a *direction* (`out`, `in` or `fwd`[^fwd]);
 - a *selector* (source subnet, destination subnet, protocol, ports);
 - a *mode* (`transport` or `tunnel`);
 - an *encapsulation protocol* (`esp` or `ah`); and
 - the endpoint *source and destination* addresses.

[^fwd]: `fwd` is for incoming packets on non-local addresses. It only makes
    sense in `transport` mode and is a Linux-only specificity.

When a matching policy is found, the kernel will look for a corresponding
security association (using `reqid` and the endpoint source and destination
addresses):

    ::console
    $ ip xfrm state
    src 2001:db8:1::1 dst 2001:db8:2::1
            proto esp spi 0xc1890b6e reqid 4 mode tunnel
            replay-window 0 flag af-unspec
            auth-trunc hmac(sha256) 0x5b68[…]8ba2904 128
            enc cbc(aes) 0x8e0e377ad8fd91e8553648340ff0fa06
            anti-replay context: seq 0x0, oseq 0x0, bitmap 0x00000000
    […]

If no security association is found, the packet is put on hold and the IKE
daemon is asked to negotiate an appropriate one. Otherwise, the packet is
encapsulated. The receiving end identifies the appropriate security association
using the SPI in the header. Two security associations are needed to establish
a bidirectionnal tunnel:

    ::console
    $ tcpdump -pni eth0 -c2 -s0 esp
    13:07:30.871150 IP6 2001:db8:1::1 > 2001:db8:2::1: ESP(spi=0xc1890b6e,seq=0x222)
    13:07:30.872297 IP6 2001:db8:2::1 > 2001:db8:1::1: ESP(spi=0xcf2426b6,seq=0x204)

All IPsec implementations are compatible with policy-based VPNs. However, some
configurations are difficult to implement. For example, consider the following
proposition for redundant site-to-site VPNs:

![Redundant VPNs between 3 sites][i1]
[i1]: [[!!images/vpn-routed.svg]] "Three sites using redundant IPsec VPNs to protect some subnets. AS 65001 borrows some IPs from one of the AS 65002 subnets."

A possible configuration between `V1-1` and `V2-1` could be:

    ::properties
    conn V1-1-to-V2-1
      left        = 2001:db8:1::1
      leftsubnet  = 2001:db8:a1::/64,2001:db8:a6::cc:1/128,2001:db8:a6::cc:5/128
      right       = 2001:db8:2::1
      rightsubnet = 2001:db8:a2::/64,2001:db8:a6::/64,2001:db8:a8::/64
      authby      = psk
      keyexchange = ikev2
      auto        = route

Each time a subnet is modified on one site, the configurations need to be
updated on all sites. Moreover, overlapping subnets (`2001:db8:­a6::/64` on one
side and `2001:db8:­a6::cc:1/128` at the other) can also be problematic.

The alternative is to use **route-based VPNs**: any packet traversing a
pseudo-interface will be encapsulated using a security policy bound to the
interface. This brings two features:

1. **Routing daemons** can be used to distribute routes to be protected by the
   VPN. This decreases the administrative burden when many subnets are present
   on each side.
2. Encapsulation and decapsulation can be executed in a **different routing
   instance or namespace**. This enables a clean separation between a private
   routing instance (where VPN users are) and a public routing instance (where
   VPN endpoints are).

# Route-based VPN on Juniper

Before looking at how to achieve that on Linux, let's have a look at the way it
works with a *Junos*-based platform (like a *Juniper vSRX*). This platform as
long-standing history of supporting route-based VPNs (a feature already present
in the *Netscreen ISG* platform).

Let's assume we want to configure the IPsec VPN from `V3-2` to `V1-1`. First, we
need to configure the tunnel interface and bind it to the "private" routing
instance containing only internal routes (with IPv4, they would have been RFC
1918 routes):

    ::junos hl_lines="13"
    interfaces {
        st0 {
            unit 1 {
                family inet6 {
                    address 2001:db8:ff::7/127;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    routing-instances {
        private {
            instance-type virtual-router;
            interface st0.1;
        }
    }

The second step is to configure the VPN:

    ::junos hl_lines="33"
    security {
        /* Phase 1 configuration */
        ike {
            proposal IKE-P1 {
                authentication-method pre-shared-keys;
                dh-group group20;
                encryption-algorithm aes-256-gcm;
            }
            policy IKE-V1-1 {
                mode main;
                proposals IKE-P1;
                pre-shared-key ascii-text "d8bdRxaY22oH1j89Z2nATeYyrXfP9ga6xC5mi0RG1uc";
            }
            gateway GW-V1-1 {
                ike-policy IKE-V1-1;
                address 2001:db8:1::1;
                external-interface lo0.1;
                general-ikeid;
                version v2-only;
            }
        }
        /* Phase 2 configuration */
        ipsec {
            proposal ESP-P2 {
                protocol esp;
                encryption-algorithm aes-256-gcm;
            }
            policy IPSEC-V1-1 {
                perfect-forward-secrecy keys group20;
                proposals ESP-P2;
            }
            vpn VPN-V1-1 {
                bind-interface st0.1;
                df-bit copy;
                ike {
                    gateway GW-V1-1;
                    ipsec-policy IPSEC-V1-1;
                }
                establish-tunnels on-traffic;
            }
        }
    }

We get a route-based VPN because we bind the `st0.1` interface to the
`VPN-V1-1` VPN. Once the VPN is up, any packet entering `st0.1` will be
encapsulated and sent to the `2001:db8:­1::1` endpoint.

The last step is to configure BGP in the "private" routing instance to exchange
routes with the remote site:

    ::junos
    routing-instances {
        private {
            routing-options {
                router-id 1.0.3.2;
                maximum-paths 16;
            }
            protocols {
                bgp {
                    preference 140;
                    log-updown;
                    group v4-VPN {
                        type external;
                        local-as 65003;
                        hold-time 6;
                        neighbor 2001:db8:ff::6 peer-as 65001;
                        multipath;
                        export [ NEXT-HOP-SELF OUR-ROUTES NOTHING ];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

The export filter `OUR-ROUTES` needs to select the routes to be advertised to
the other peers. For example:

    ::junos
    policy-options {
        policy-statement OUR-ROUTES {
            term 10 {
                from {
                    protocol ospf3;
                    route-type internal;
                }
                then {
                    metric 0;
                    accept;
                }
            }
        }
    }

The configuration needs to be repeated for the other peers. The complete version
is available on [GitHub][junos-conf]. Once the BGP sessions are up, we start
learning routes from the other sites. For example, here is the route for
`2001:db8:­a1::/64`:

    ::console
    > show route 2001:db8:a1::/64 protocol bgp table private.inet6.0 best-path

    private.inet6.0: 15 destinations, 19 routes (15 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
    + = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both

    2001:db8:a1::/64   *[BGP/140] 01:12:32, localpref 100, from 2001:db8:ff::6
                          AS path: 65001 I, validation-state: unverified
                          to 2001:db8:ff::6 via st0.1
                        > to 2001:db8:ff::14 via st0.2

It was learnt both from `V1-1` (through `st0.1`) and `V1-2` (through
`st0.2`). The route is part of the `private` routing instance but encapsulated
packets are sent/received in the `public` routing instance. No route-leaking is
needed for this configuration. The VPN cannot be used as a gateway from internal
hosts to external hosts (or vice-versa). This could also have been done with
Junos' security policies (stateful firewall rules) but doing the separation with
routing instances also ensure routes from different domains are not mixed and a
simple policy misconfiguration won't lead to a disaster.

# Route-based VPN on Linux

Starting from Linux 3.15, a similar configuration is possible with the help of a
virtual tunnel interface.[^history] First, we create the "private" namespace:

    ::console
    # ip netns add private
    # ip netns exec private sysctl -qw net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1

[^history]: Virtual tunnel interfaces (VTI) were introduced in Linux 3.6 (for
    IPv4) and Linux 3.12 (for IPv6). Appropriate namespace support was added in
    3.15. *KLIPS*, an alternative out-of-tree stack available since Linux 2.2,
    also features tunnel interfaces.

Any "private" interface needs to be moved to this namespace (no IP is configured
as we can use IPv6 link-local addresses):

    ::console
    # ip link set netns private dev eth1
    # ip link set netns private dev eth2
    # ip netns exec private ip link set up dev eth1
    # ip netns exec private ip link set up dev eth2

Then, we create `vti6`, a tunnel interface (similar to `st0.1` in the *Junos*
example):

    ::console hl_lines="5 6"
    # ip -6 tunnel add vti6 \
    >  mode vti6 \
    >  local 2001:db8:1::1 \
    >  remote 2001:db8:3::2 \
    >  key 6
    # ip link set netns private dev vti6
    # ip netns exec private ip addr add 2001:db8:ff::6/127 dev vti6
    # ip netns exec private sysctl -qw net.ipv4.conf.vti6.disable_policy=1
    # ip netns exec private ip link set vti6 mtu 1500
    # ip netns exec private ip link set vti6 up

The tunnel interface is created in the initial namespace and moved to the
"private" one. It will remember its original namespace where it will process
encapsulated packets. Any packet entering the interface will temporarily get a
firewall mark of 6 that will be used only to match the appropriate IPsec
policy[^netfilter] below. The kernel sets a low MTU on the interface to handle
any possible combination of ciphers and protocols. We set it to 1500 and let
PMTUD do its work.

!!! "Update (2018-04)" The MTU is also too low due to a bug that is fixed in
[commit c6741fbed6dc][] (released with Linux 4.17).

[^netfilter]: The mark is set right before doing a policy lookup and restored
    after that. Consequently, it doesn't affect other possible uses (filtering,
    routing). However, as Netfilter can also set a mark, one should be careful
    for conflicts.

We can then configure *strongSwan*:[^ciphers]

    ::properties hl_lines="3 5 7"
    conn V3-2
      left        = 2001:db8:1::1
      leftsubnet  = ::/0
      right       = 2001:db8:3::2
      rightsubnet = ::/0
      authby      = psk
      mark        = 6
      auto        = route
      keyexchange = ikev2
      keyingtries = %forever
      ike         = aes256gcm16-prfsha384-ecp384!
      esp         = aes256gcm16-prfsha384-ecp384!
      mobike      = no

[^ciphers]: The ciphers used here are the strongest ones currently possible
    while keeping compatibility with *Junos*. The documentation for *strongSwan*
    contains a [complete list of supported algorithms][] as well
    as [security recommendations][] to choose them.

The IKE daemon configures the following policies in the kernel:

    ::console hl_lines="4 9 14"
    $ ip xfrm policy
    src ::/0 dst ::/0
            dir out priority 399999 ptype main
            mark 0x6/0xffffffff
            tmpl src 2001:db8:1::1 dst 2001:db8:3::2
                    proto esp reqid 1 mode tunnel
    src ::/0 dst ::/0
            dir fwd priority 399999 ptype main
            mark 0x6/0xffffffff
            tmpl src 2001:db8:3::2 dst 2001:db8:1::1
                    proto esp reqid 1 mode tunnel
    src ::/0 dst ::/0
            dir in priority 399999 ptype main
            mark 0x6/0xffffffff
            tmpl src 2001:db8:3::2 dst 2001:db8:1::1
                    proto esp reqid 1 mode tunnel
    […]

These policies are used for any source or destination as long as the firewall
mark is equal to 6, which matches the mark configured for the tunnel interface.

The last step is to configure BGP to exchange routes. We can use [BIRD][] for this:

    ::junos
    router id 1.0.1.1;
    protocol device {
       scan time 10;
    }
    protocol kernel {
       persist;
       learn;
       import all;
       export all;
       merge paths yes;
    }
    protocol bgp IBGP_V3_2 {
       local 2001:db8:ff::6 as 65001;
       neighbor 2001:db8:ff::7 as 65003;
       import all;
       export where ifname ~ "eth*";
       preference 160;
       hold time 6;
    }

Once *BIRD* is started in the "private" namespace, we can check routes are learned
correctly:

    ::console
    $ ip netns exec private ip -6 route show 2001:db8:a3::/64
    2001:db8:a3::/64 proto bird metric 1024
            nexthop via 2001:db8:ff::5  dev vti5 weight 1
            nexthop via 2001:db8:ff::7  dev vti6 weight 1

The above route was learnt from both `V3-1` (through `vti5`) and `V3-2` (through
`vti6`). Like for the *Junos* version, there is no route-leaking between the
"private" namespace and the initial one. The VPN cannot be used as a gateway
between the two namespaces, only for encapsulation. This also prevent a
misconfiguration (for example, IKE daemon not running) from allowing packets to
leave the private network.

As a bonus, unencrypted traffic can be observed with `tcpdump` on the tunnel
interface:

    ::console
    $ ip netns exec private tcpdump -pni vti6 icmp6
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
    listening on vti6, link-type LINUX_SLL (Linux cooked), capture size 262144 bytes
    20:51:15.258708 IP6 2001:db8:a1::1 > 2001:db8:a3::1: ICMP6, echo request, seq 69
    20:51:15.260874 IP6 2001:db8:a3::1 > 2001:db8:a1::1: ICMP6, echo reply, seq 69

You can find all the configuration files for this example on [GitHub][]. The
documentation of *strongSwan* also features a [page about route-based
VPNs][]. It is possible to [replace IPsec by WireGuard][], a fast and modern VPN
implementation.

!!! "Update (2018-11)" It is also possible to transport IPv4 on top of IPv6
IPsec tunnels. The lab has been [updated][v4overv6] to support such a scenario.

!!! "Update (2018-11)" There are some serious bugs starting from Linux 4.14
impacting this setup. Be sure to apply the following patches: [9e1437937807][]
and [0152eee6fc3b][]—both applied to stable trees.
