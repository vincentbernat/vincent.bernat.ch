I have bought a [Samsung Galaxy S][sgs] Android phone some time
ago. One of the first thing that you try to do with such a phone is to
switch to some alternate firmware (the coined term is "ROM"), like
[CyanogenMod][cm]. Flashing a firmware is a whole new universe. You
are told about a lot of proprietary tools, you need to download a lot
of things from MegaUpload and friends and nobody really explains
what's going on under the hood. I was a bit lost at first.

I will not provide a step-by-step guide since I cannot afford to stay
up-to-date. Such a guide is usually posted on some forum. It assumes
you are running Windows and provides appropriate download links. You
**must** follow it (and check that it is recent enough). I will just
provide you some background to understand these guides.

[TOC]

# Android firmwares

There are several Android firmwares. Most of them are specific to a
given phone (or its close variations). They can be sorted in three
categories:

 1. **Official firmwares** from the phone manufacturer include a
    kernel with appropriate drivers and, usually, a customized
    interface (HTC Sense for HTC, TouchWiz for Samsung). Some
    manufacturers will lag a lot behind Android schedule and you may
    not get all the new shiny features.
 2. **Modified firmwares** are built from the official firmwares. They
    usually add a lot of hacks on top of the original firmware, remove
    some cruft but are still closely related to the official firmware.
 3. **Firmwares built from [Android Open Source Project][aosp]** (the
    open source version of Android) do not share nothing with the
    official firmware except some bits related to the kernel (drivers,
    hacks).

## Darky ROM

[Darky ROM][darky] is a modified firmware. It takes the original
firmware from Samsung, adds a custom kernel (based on the source of
the official kernel), adds a lot of hacks, some additional
applications and removes some unwanted cruft. This is a very nice
firmware which is quite snappy. This is a drop-in replacement for the
default firmware: you will only get improvements.

The [latest version is 10.1][darky10] and there is a
[neat guide on how to install it][darkyguide].

## CyanogenMod

[CyanogenMod][cm] is a firmware built from AOSP. It supports several
devices and provide a unified firmware on all of them. Support for
the Samsung Galaxy S is recent and is not present in the stable
build. However, [some RC build is now available][cmdl]. Be sure to
read the [FAQ][cmfaq] (most notably the part saying that you need to
install from Froyo 2.2 because the bootloader provided by Samsung with
Gingerbread 2.3 is not compatible). You can also grab some information
[from the wiki][cmwiki].

The major drawback of using this firmware instead of going for a modified
firmware like Darky ROM is that the battery life may suck. I now need to
charge my phone every day instead of once every two days. On the plus
side, you get a very clean firmware with a lot of features and almost no
cruft. For example, the notification bar can be customized and OpenVPN
is available out of the box.

!!! "Update (2011-07)" After a few weeks, the battery life is similar
to what the original firmware provides. Maybe it was just a
calibration problem.

Moreover, almost everything is open source (if you don't install
Google apps). You can see this firmware as an open source distribution
for your phone. There is no need to download random files linked from
a random forum to make it work. There is no package manager,
though. Despite the bad battery life, I prefer this firmware.

# Prerequisites

Before trying to flash a new firmware, there are some tools that you
need to have. Note that you don't need root access to flash a new
firmware.

## Download & recovery mode

Before trying to install any firmware, you must check that your phone
can access **download** and **recovery** modes. The download mode
allows you to flash any new firmware, even if the current firmware
does not boot at all. As long as this mode is available, there is very
little chance that you brick your phone. To access these modes, you
need to use the "three-button combo." Here are the steps (your phone
should not be plugged):

 1. Power off the phone (wait for the phone to vibrate).
 2. Hold the "Volume down" button for *download* mode. Hold the "Volume
    up" button for *recovery* mode.
 3. Hold the "Home" button.
 4. Hold the "Power" button. The phone will start.
 5. Once you have the Samsung logo displayed on the screen, release
    the "Power" button.
 6. Only release the two other buttons when you enter the recovery mode
    or download mode. The recovery mode displays a menu. The download
    mode displays a big yellow Android logo.

If after ten tries, you are unable to access these modes, maybe they
have been disabled. Keep reading, there is a solution.

## Heimdall

[Heimdall][heimdall] is a tool to flash a new firmware to your
phone. This is not a mandatory tool but you will have to use it if
something goes wrong. Most guides will tell you to use *Odin*. It is a
leaked Samsung tool running on Windows only. You can use Heimdall
instead.

    ::console
    $ git clone https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall.git
    Cloning into Heimdall...
    remote: Counting objects: 423, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (271/271), done.
    remote: Total 423 (delta 220), reused 332 (delta 138)
    Receiving objects: 100% (423/423), 5.91 MiB | 962 KiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (220/220), done.
    $ cd Heimdall/heimdall
    $ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
    $ ./configure && make
    [...]
    $ sudo cp 60-heimdall-galaxy-s.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/udev reload

You need to use this tool while in download mode. You can test it,
while in download mode, with:

    ::console
    $ ./heimdall print-pit

This will display the partition table of your phone. This is
enlightening to know what it contains:

 - `IBL+PBL` is the boot loader, be extra careful with it;
 - `PIT` is the partition table;
 - `EFS` contains some important data like IEMEI, be extra careful with it;
 - `SBL` is the second boot loader;
 - `SBL2` is the backup of the second boot loader;
 - `PARAM` contains some images used as various stage of the boot process;
 - `KERNEL` is the kernel;
 - `RECOVERY` is the backup of the kernel;
 - `FACTORYFS` contains `/system` file system which is some kind of
   root file system;
 - `DBDATA` contains `/data` file system which is the database to
   store application parameters;
 - `CACHE` contains `/cache` file system which contains the Dalvik
   cache;
 - `MODEM` contains the firmware for the modem.

As we will see, Heimdall is able to flash any of these partitions with
`flash` subcommand.

## adb

[adb][adb] stands for Android Debug Bridge. Among other things, this
tool allow you to drive your phone through the USB connection. You can
get a shell, reboot into download or recovery mode, push files to your
Android device, etc.

To get this tool, you need to [download the full Android SDK][sdk].

    ::console
    $ tar zxvf ~/download/android-sdk_r11-linux_x86.tgz
    $ cd android-sdk-linux_x86
    $ tools/android update sdk
    [select Android SDK Platform-tools]
    $ platform-tools/adb shell
    # uname -a
    Linux localhost 2.6.35.7-I9000XWJVH-CL184813 #Dark_Core_2.4 PREEMPT Mon May 16 15:02:38 EEST 2011 armv7l GNU/Linux

The important commands are:

 - `shell` to get a shell on the device;
 - `reboot recovery` to reboot in recovery mode;
 - `reboot download` to reboot in download mode;
 - `push` to put a file on the phone;
 - `pull` to retrieve a file;
 - `install` to install an application from its APK;
 - `logcat` to see the logs and what happens, very useful!

## Restore download mode

If your phone is missing download mode, you can recover it with the
help of `adb` and `heimdall`. You need to grab
some official firmware and extract `boot.bin` and
`Sbl.bin` from it.

    ::console
    $ adb reboot download
    $ heimdall flash --primary-boot ~/download/boot.bin --secondary-boot ~/download/Sbl.bin

Be extra careful here. You may brick your phone. Double check that you
grab the correct files and that they are really for your phone (there
exists some variants). It worked for me.

# Installing a new firmware

While you can switch from one firmware to another without losing your data,
it is better to *wipe* your system and your data before switching
firmware. This means that you will lose all your applications and the data
inside them (list of contacts, SMS, preferences). However, nothing
will ever modify your data in the internal SD card or in the external
SD card (which are both inside the phone). They usually contains your
music and your photos.

There are two ways to install a firmware:

 1. via Heimdall, or
 2. using the recovery.

## Heimdall

When a guide tells you to use Odin, you can use Heimdall instead. Odin
takes a TAR file. You should untar it and uses its content with
Heimdall. For example:

    ::console
    $ ./heimdall flash --repartition --pit s1_odin_20100512.pit \
                       --factoryfs factoryfs.rfs \
                       --cache cache.rfs --dbdata dbdata.rfs \
                       --param param.lfs --modem modem.bin \
                       --kernel zImage --secondary-boot Sbl.bin 
    Claiming interface again...   Success
    Setting up interface...   Success
    Beginning session...
    Handshaking with Loke...   Success

    Uploading PIT
    PIT upload successful
    Uploading SBL
    100%
    SBL upload successful
    Uploading KERNEL
    100%
    KERNEL upload successful
    Uploading MODEM
    100%
    MODEM upload successful
    Uploading PARAM
    100%
    PARAM upload successful
    Uploading FACTORYFS
    100%
    FACTORYFS upload successful
    Uploading DBDATAFS
    100%
    DBDATAFS upload successful
    Uploading CACHE
    100%
    CACHE upload successful
    Ending session...
    Rebooting device...

You may be interested to update your modem using Heimdall. This is
usually independent of the firmware you want to use. Also, no need to
provide a PIT file if you don't want to repartition. Heimdall can read
the current one and flash only one of the partitions.

## Recovery mode

The base recovery shipped with the Samsung Galaxy S does not have a
lot of options. Moreover, it may be locked and will accept to install
only signed firmwares. Most firmwares come with *ClockWorkMod*, a more
advanced recovery. Once you get it, you will be able to use any ZIP
file to install a new firmware.

My advice is to try to get *ClockWorkMod* as soon as possible. If you
are root, you can install [ROM Manager][rommanager] that will install
it for you. If you are not root, most custom firmwares will provide
*ClockWorkMod*. Therefore, you can install a custom firmware with
Heimdall. There exists special firmwares just for this, like
EZbase. If you want to install CyanogenMod, be sure to download a
Froyo firmware, not a Gingerbread one.

Keep in mind that the recovery is located inside the kernel. It is not
self-contained in the bootloader (unlike download mode). If you don't
want to flash a whole firmware (and lose everything on your phone)
just to get the recovery, you can just flash the kernel.

The *ClockWorkMod* recovery comes with a utility to backup your whole
phone. This way, you can easily restore your previous firmware if you
don't like the current one. This is what is called a *Nandroid*
backup.

## Lagfix

A lot of guides will tell you to enable or disable lagfix. Samsung
shipped the Galaxy S with some crappy filesystem called RFS (which is
some kind of "enhanced" FAT). It is slow and seems responsible for
some lags that may happen on the interface. A *lagfix* is a way to
replace this filesystem by something better, like EXT4 or YAFFS2. The
process is pretty straightforward and consist to backup all the
partition to the SD card, reformat it with another filesystem and
restore the backup.

The lagfix may be applied automatically with some firmware (like
CyanogenMod) or you may request it in the recovery mode (most modified
firmwares work this way). In this case, it will be applied
automatically on the next boot. You should disable it before
installing another firmware with the recovery mode (no need if you
install it with Heimdall).

# Applications

You can find many free (as in free speech) applications for
Android. Unfortunately, Android Market does not allow one to use this
criteria as a filter. [F-Droid][fdroid] is an alternate market
featuring only FOSS applications.

Here is a short selection of free applications:

 - [ADW.Launcher][adw] is a home replacement app. It is very
   configurable and themable.
 - [K-9 Mail][k9] is a very nice email client.
 - [Xabber][xabber] is a XMPP/Jabber client.
 - [ConnectBot][connectbot] is an SSH client (as well as a terminal).
 - [DroidWall][droidwall] is an application firewall (using
   Netfilter). It lets you select which application can access to
   Internet depending on your connection (wifi or 3G).
 - [Barcode Scanner][barcode] decodes 1D/2D barcode including QR
   codes.
 - [OsmAnd][osm] is a replacement for Google Maps using
   OpenStreetMap. The free version on Android Market is out-dated. Buy
   the "plus" version or download it through F-Droid.

Another must-have application is [Titanium Backup][titanium] which
allows you to backup any application with data. Unfortunately, this is not
a free (as in free speech) application.
