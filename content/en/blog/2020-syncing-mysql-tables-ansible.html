The [`community.mysql` collection][collection] from [Ansible Galaxy][]
provides a `mysql_query` module to run arbitrary MySQL queries.
Unfortunately, it does not support check mode nor the `--diff` flag.
It is also unable to tell if there was a change. Let's write a
specific Ansible module to workaround these issues.

!!! "Notice" I recommend that you read "[Writing a custom Ansible
module][]" as an introduction.

# Code

The [module][] has the following signature and it executes the
provided SQL statements in a single transaction. It needs a list of
the affected tables to be able to detect and show the changes.

    ::yaml
    mysql_sync:
      sql: |
        DELETE FROM rules WHERE name LIKE 'CMDB:%';
        INSERT INTO rules (name, rule) VALUES
          ('CMDB: check for cats', ':is(object, "CAT")'),
          ('CMDB: check for dogs', ':is(object, "DOG")');
        REPLACE INTO webhooks (name, url) VALUES
          ('OpsGenie', 'https://opsgenie/something/token'),
          ('Slack', 'https://slack/something/token');
      user: monitoring
      password: Yooghah5
      database: monitoring
      tables:
        - rules
        - webhooks

## Prerequisites

The module does not enforce idempotency, but it is expected you
provide appropriate SQL queries. In the above example, idempotency is
achieved because the content of the `rules` table is deleted and
recreated from scratch while the rows in the `webhooks` table are
replaced if they already exist.

You need the [PyMySQL][] package.

## Module definition

Starting from the skeleton described in the [previous article][Writing
a custom Ansible module], here is the module definition:

    ::python
    module_args = dict(
        sql=dict(type='str', required=True),
        user=dict(type='str', required=True),
        password=dict(type='str', required=True, no_log=True),
        database=dict(type='str', required=True),
        tables=dict(type='list', required=True, elements='str'),
    )

    result = dict(
        changed=False
    )

    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=module_args,
        supports_check_mode=True
    )

The password is marked with `no_log` to ensure it won't be displayed
or stored, notably when `ansible-playbook` runs in verbose mode. There
is no `host` option as the module is executed on the MySQL host.
Strong authentication using certificates is not implemented either.
This matches our goal with custom modules: only implement what you
strictly need.

## Getting the current rows

The next step is to retrieve the records currently in the database.
The `got` dictionary is a mapping from table names to the list of rows
they contain:

    ::python
    got = {}
    tables = module.params['tables']

    connection = pymysql.connect(
        user=module.params['user'],
        password=module.params['password'],
        db=module.params['database'],
        charset='utf8mb4',
        cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor
    )

    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        for table in tables:
            cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM {}".format(table))
            got[table] = cursor.fetchall()

## Computing the changes

Let's now build the `wanted` dictionary. The trick is to execute the
SQL statements in a transaction without issuing a final commit. The
changes will be invisible[^transaction] to other readers and we can
compare the final rows with the rows collected in `got`:

    ::python
    wanted = {}
    sql = module.params['sql']
    statements = [statement.strip()
                  for statement in sql.split(";\n")
                  if statement.strip()]

    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        for statement in statements:
            try:
                cursor.execute(statement)
            except pymysql.OperationalError as err:
                code, message = err.args
                result['msg'] = "MySQL error for {}: {}".format(
                    statement,
                    message)
                module.fail_json(**result)
        for table in tables:
            cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM {}".format(table))
            wanted[table] = cursor.fetchall()

[^transaction]: The tables need to use the InnoDB storage engine.
    Moreover, MySQL does not know how to use transactions with DDL
    statements: do not modify table definitions!

The first `for` loop executes each statement. On error, we return a
helpful message containing the faulty one. The second `for` loop
records the final rows of each table in `wanted`.

## Applying changes

Back to the skeleton described in the [previous article][Writing a
custom Ansible module], the last step is to apply the changes if there
is a difference between `got` and `wanted` when not running with check
mode. The `diff` object is a bit more elaborate as it is built table
by table. This enables Ansible to display the name of each table
before the diff representation:

    ::python
    if got != wanted:
        result['changed'] = True
        result['diff'] = [dict(
            before_header=table,
            after_header=table,
            before=yaml.safe_dump(got[table]),
            after=yaml.safe_dump(wanted[table]))
                          for table in tables
                          if got[table] != wanted[table]]

    if module.check_mode or not result['changed']:
        module.exit_json(**result)

Applying the changes is quite trivial: just commit them! Otherwise,
they are lost when the module exits.

    ::python
    connection.commit()

The complete code is available on [GitHub][module]. Compared to the
`mysql_query` module, this one supports the check mode, signals
correctly if there is a change and displays the differences. However,
it should not be used with huge tables, as it would try to load them
in memory.
