Here are the slides about how we started to use Go at [Exoscale][]
in 2018. It was presented during an [eValais.ch session][] around the
language, in Martigny, Switzerland.

At the time, I was seduced by the good parts, including the tooling
and the ecosystem. However, there were several bad parts: `GOPATH`, no
generics, no versioning, and bad and unstable dependency management.
With the release of [Go 1.18 supporting generics][], all these are now
solved!
