Ten years ago, I started to use [ZSH][zsh], a shell designed for
interactive use but which is also powerful for scripting usage. I had
a fairly comprehensive `.zshrc` file splitted in several parts. I have
decided to rewrite it for several reasons:

 1. I did not take advantage of several features of ZSH, like some
 advanced parameter expansion, arrays, arithmetic expressions and
 other built-in features. There were a lot of `| head`, `| awk`, `|
 sed` that could be replaced by some ZSH machinery (something easier
 to read like `${${(f)~~"$(</etc/hosts)"}%%\#*}`).

 2. It contained a lot of hacks to make things work on some odd/old
 setups. I was not really sure that those hacks are useful anymore. It
 also contained a lot of conditionals where some parts of the code
 were executed depending on the hostname.

I have discovered [`oh-my-zsh`][ohmyzsh], a nice project trying to
provide a generic and flexible ZSH configuration:

> A community-driven framework for managing your zsh
> configuration. Includes 40+ optional plugins (rails, git, OSX, hub,
> capistrano, brew, ant, macports, etc), over 80 terminal themes to
> spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool so that makes it easy
> to keep up with the latest updates from the community.

The idea of such a project is to fork it and make the changes that you
need. I was previously hacking around [Phil!'s ZSH Prompt][phils] for
my prompt. `oh-my-zsh` contains a close theme (`jonathan`). Neat.
However, I decided to write my `.zshrc` from scratch (but with some
snippets stolen from `oh-my-zsh`). Why? Mostly because I want to
precisely configure ZSH. Even with its plugin architecture and its
override mechanism, `oh-my-zsh` provides some features (options,
aliases, functions) that I do not want. Of course, thanks to git, you
can fork and make any local changes you want but since I would have
modified most of the files, it seemed easier to just start from
scratch.

I have published the result on [GitHub][github]. You can use it as is,
fork it or (better) steal and adapt some snippets for your own
usage. Here is the mandatory screenshot for the prompt (no much space
left for the commands):

**UPDATED:** Since I am now using [awesome window manager][], I have
dropped the right part of the prompt because it does not behave well
when resizing windows.  You can get the previous prompt by checking
out [tag `before-awesome`][before-awesome]. I have then switched to a
[powerline prompt][]. This kind of prompt needs a [special font][]. To
get the previous prompt, checkout
[tag `before-powerline`][before-powerline]. Here is what the new
prompt looks like:

Here is a short snippet used to select a sensible `EDITOR` depending
on what is available. It uses anonymous functions (to restrict the
scope of local variables), arrays and flags in parameter
expansion. For another example, take a look on
[how I select a valid locale][locale].

    ::bash
    () {
        local -a editors
        local editor
        editors=(
            "emacs23 -Q -D -nw" # Fast emacs
            "jove" "mg" "jed"   # Emacs clone
            "vim" "vi"          # vi
            "editor")           # fallback
        for editor in $editors; do
            (( $+commands[$editor[(w)1]] )) && {
                export EDITOR=$editor
                break
            }
        done
    }

Enjoy!

**UPDATED:** Anonymous functions were introduced in ZSH 4.3.7. Older
versions do not support them. A workaround is to use a classic
function instead:

    ::bash
    __() {
        local -a editors
        local editor
        ...
    } && __
