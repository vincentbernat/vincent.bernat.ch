Here are the slides of a presentation around Debian debug packages.
They were presented during a [Debian France][] meetup in [2013][]. The
goal was to move forward Debian effort to get automatic debug
packages, like it was the case for Ubuntu and Fedora. Until [2015][],
debug packages were only available for a selection of packages.
Ultimately, except by raising some awareness around the issue, I was
not involved in the actual implementation.
