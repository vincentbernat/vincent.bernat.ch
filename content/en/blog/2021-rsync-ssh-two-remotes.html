`scp -3` can copy files between two remote hosts through localhost.
This comes in handy when the two servers cannot communicate
directly or if they are unable to authenticate one to the
other.[^agent] Unfortunately, `rsync` does not support such a feature.
Here is a trick to emulate the behavior of `scp -3` with SSH tunnels.

[^agent]: And [SSH agent forwarding is dangerous][]. Don't use it if you can.

When syncing with a remote host, `rsync` invokes `ssh` to spawn a
remote `rsync --server` process. It interacts with it through its
standard input and output. The idea is to recreate the same setup
using SSH tunnels and [socat][], a versatile tool to establish
bidirectional data transfers.

The first step is to connect to the source server and ask `rsync` the
command-line to spawn the remote `rsync --server` process. The `-e`
flag overrides the command to use to get a remote shell: instead of
`ssh`, we use `echo`.

    ::console hl_lines="3"
    $ ssh web04
    $ rsync -e 'sh -c ">&2 echo $@" echo' -aLv /data/. web05:/data/.
    web05 rsync --server -vlogDtpre.iLsfxCIvu . /data/.
    rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
    rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(228) [sender=3.2.3]

The second step is to connect to the destination server with *local*
port forwarding. When connecting to the local port 5000, the TCP
connection is forwarded through SSH to the remote port 5000 and
handled by `socat`. When receiving the connection, `socat` spawns the
`rsync --server` command we got at the previous step and connects its
standard input and output to the incoming TCP socket.

    ::console
    $ ssh -L 127.0.0.1:5000:127.0.0.1:5000 web05
    $ socat tcp-listen:5000,reuseaddr exec:"rsync --server -vlogDtpre.iLsfxCIvu . /data/."

The last step is to connect to the source with *remote* port
forwarding. `socat` is used in place of a regular SSH connection and
connects its standard input and output to a TCP socket connected to the
remote port 5000. Thanks to the remote port forwarding, SSH forwards
the data to the local port 5000. From there, it is relayed back to the
destination, as described in the previous step.

    ::console
    $ ssh -R 127.0.0.1:5000:127.0.0.1:5000 web04
    $ rsync -e 'sh -c "socat stdio tcp-connect:127.0.0.1:5000"' -aLv /data/. remote:/data/.

This little diagram may help understand how everything fits together:

is connected together. Arrows labeled “stdio” are implemented as two
pipes connecting the process to the left to the standard input and
output of the process to the right. Don't be fooled by the apparent
symmetry!")

The [rsync manual page][] prohibits the use of `--server`. Use this
hack at your own risk!

# Addendum

I was hoping to get something similar with a one-liner. But this does
not work!

    ::console
    $ socat \
    >  exec:"ssh web04 rsync --server --sender -vlLogDtpre.iLsfxCIvu . /data/." \
    >  exec:"ssh web05 rsync --server -vlogDtpre.iLsfxCIvu /data/. /data/." \
