Back in the dark ages of the web, before the introduction of CSS 3,
browsers could only display fonts available on the client
system. Thanks to the introduction of `@font-face` and its now
widespread support, this is over. Now, Web designers have access to a
large selection of fonts and most users will be able to appreciate
them.

[Typekit][typekit] provides a subscription-based library of hosted,
high-quality fonts to use on websites. I expose here my own, mostly
uneducated[^educated] on the typographic side, look on this service.

[^educated]: While I have a high interest in typography, have my own
             copy of “[The Elements of Typographic Style][elements]” by
             Robert Bringhurst and have throughly read
             “[The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web][webtypography]”,
             I am still fairly novice on this matter.

# Fonts embedding 101

There are several ways to embed fonts for the Web. Let's have a look
at the most common ones.

## Self-hosting and `@font-face`

A first possibility is to host fonts yourself and provide a CSS file
with the appropriate `@font-face` declarations. There are five
important things to know:

 1. There is **no common format**. You will need to host different
    versions of the same font to support most browsers.
 2. Of course, Internet Explorer comes with its own **quirks** that
    you need to work around.
 3. Most browsers enforce a **[same origin policy][sop]**. You need to
    serve your fonts from the same domain as the requesting page. You
    can circumvent such a limitation by enabling
    [cross-origin resource sharing][cors]: add an
    `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header when serving fonts.
 4. Fonts are unlikely to change. To **leverage caching**, configure
    an explicit expiration date far in the future. Something like 30
    days.
 5. There is no [MIME types registered for fonts][mime]. Don't bother
    setting one, even if Google Chrome likes to complain about them in
    the console.

One great resource is [Font Squirrel][squirrel] which provides kits
with fonts and the appropriate CSS declarations. You choose your font
family (or upload one of your own), the formats that you want to use
(check them all) and you will get a ZIP archive with all fonts and a
CSS file. You may want to tweak it a bit to enable automatic use of
the bold variant when needed and to use a local copy if available. For
example, if you choose _Crimson_, an oldstyle typeface, you may want
to declare the bold version with `font-weight: bold` and add local
names:

    ::css
    @font-face {
        font-family: 'Crimson';
        src: url('Crimson-Bold-webfont.eot');
        src: local('Crimson Bold'), local('Crimson Text Bold'),
             url('Crimson-Bold-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
             url('Crimson-Bold-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
             url('Crimson-Bold-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),
             url('Crimson-Bold-webfont.svg#CrimsonBold') format('svg');
        font-weight: bold;
        font-style: normal;
    }

## Google Web Fonts

For open-source fonts, you can also use
[Google Web Fonts][googlefonts] instead of hosting the files
yourself. Build a collection of fonts and choose the variants that you
want to use for each of them. You will then be provided with a code
snippet to paste in the `<head>` element of your page. For example,
for _Crimson_:

    ::html
    <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Crimson+Text:400,700,400italic'
          rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>

Why choose this solution over self-hosting?

 1. You don't use your own **bandwith** to serve fonts. This may be
    important if you pay for it.
 2. Google uses its own **CDN** to serve fonts. If you don't use a CDN
    yourself, this can be a major performance improvement.
 3. **Caching** is more efficient since many sites will use the same font.
 4. It's **easier** to do it right.

Unless you are concerned about Google tracking your users[^track], I
think this is a better solution than self-hosting. Quick delivery of
fonts is pretty important since content rendering can be delayed by
them.

[^track]: Google serves fonts from a cookie-less domain. Technically,
          they could still do some kind of tracking but I believe they
          don't.

## Paid services

If you would like to use commercial fonts, like _Adobe Minion Pro_ or
_Paratype Futura PT_, a convenient option is to rent
them. [Typekit][typekit] is service providing such an option. Pricing
depends on volume and the number of fonts you want to have access
to. There is a free plan and the first paid plan is US$24.99 per
year. Other [similar services][smashing] exist. Feel free to compare.

Once registered, the workflow is similar to _Google Web Fonts_. You
choose your fonts, assemble them in a "kit" and publish it. Instead
of directly providing a CSS file, _Typekit_ provides some Javascript
which will in turn download a CSS file containing all fonts in the
appropriate format for the browser (on most browsers, fonts are
_inlined_).

    ::html
    <script type="text/javascript"
            src="//use.typekit.com/tyt0atd.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      try{Typekit.load();}catch(e){}
    </script>

# Typekit: the good parts...

So, why choose _Typekit_? First, there is the **very large choice of
fonts**. The first paid plan comes with more than 500 fonts from about
80 foundries. There are about a hundred serif fonts and a couple
hundred sans serif ones.

_Typekit_ provides a **convenient interface to browse fonts**. You can
either search fonts by name or by characteristics. In the last case,
you can filter on properties like the classification (serif, sans
serif, decorative, etc.), weight, width, contrast, x-height,
recommended use or language support. Once a font is selected and added
to your kit, you can easily choose what variants you want. The kit
total size is displayed.

If you happen to meet any problem or have some questions, _Typekit_
**support is very responsive**. I got clear and crisp answers in less
than a few hours in the week-end.

# ...and the bad ones

Unfortunately, _Typekit_ has also some shortcomings. One of the most
commonly cited is that Javascript is mandatory. No Javascript, no
fonts. If you want to display the appropriate fonts for users without
Javascript, you should just not use _Typekit_.

## Not free, nor free

While _Typekit_ offers some open-source fonts, most of them are
not. Moreover, only a few of them are available in the free
plan. While I would prefer to use open-source fonts, I don't consider
this a strong requirement: if you are dissatisfied for some reason,
switching back to open-source fonts (or another service) is fast and
easy.

I like serif fonts a lot and they get less attention from the FLOSS
world: it is difficult to find one whose readability on screen is
excellent. _Droid Serif_ is a nice font but is a bit too black for
me. Maybe _Cardo_ would be a good match.

You may disagree and in this case, [Google Web Fonts][googlefonts] or
self-hosting seem the perfect match.

## Difficulty to choose and test fonts

While browsing fonts is easy and smooth, choosing and testing them is
another matter. For example, _Typekit_ is missing some interface to
compare font rendering for whole paragraphs at a given size. It also
misses a way to check how two fonts render together, one for headings
and one for paragraphs. Here, _Google Web Fonts_ is more versatile.

Things become really difficult when you want to test your selected
fonts for real. Except if you have invested into one of the expensive
plans, you can only include a limited number of fonts in your
kit. Each time you want to try another set of fonts, you need to
modify your kit and wait for it to be distributed across _Typekit_
network. You may have to **wait five or ten minutes between each
change**!

Another inconvenient thing is that once you publish your site, any
change to the kit will affect the published version. Therefore,
you need to use a second kit for development and play back and
forth with those two kits.

What would be convenient here is a special kit with all fonts from the
library with restricted access to some IP to avoid abuse. This is
something done by [Fontdeck][fontdeck], a competitor.

## Poor subset support

Because you want to keep the font size small (about 30 kB for each
variant), _Typekit_ usually proposes two subsets: the default one
contains **only latin characters** and the complete one with **all
glyphs**. If some glyph is absent from the default subset, you need to
use the complete one which is roughly two to four times the size of
the default one. This is a bit huge for only one character.

What would be nice is to have subsets for each language. In my case, I
would take a French subset because I need the "œ" glyph which appears
in French in words like "_cœur_" (_heart_ or _core_) or "_œil_"
(_eye_). I don't want to select the complete subset just for this
character.

When a glyph is absent, the next font in the CSS stack is used. For
example, if the selected font is _FF Tisa Web Pro_ and the next font
in the stack is _Droid Serif_, here is how the word "_cœur_" may be
rendered. On the first line, _FF Tisa Web Pro_ contains the
appropriate glyph. On the second line, the glyph is absent and taken
from _Droid Serif_. Since x-height and contrast are a bit different,
the replaced glyph seems out of tone. At small sizes, the difference
accounts for more than 10%.

![Various rendering of word "cœur"][img-oe]
[img-oe]: [[!!images/typekit/ligatures.png]] "Rendering when glyph is present, substituted by a glyph from another font or emulated. Rendering at 72px and 16px (zoomed)."

I have also added a third line where the ligature is built from "o"
and "e" and the following style is applied to "e":

    ::css
    .lf-ligature {
        margin-left: -0.172em;
        zoom: 1; /* Here to trigger hasLayout on IE7 */
    }

As you can see, the result seems good. I have a
[piece of Javascript][ligature-js] turning a ligature into the
appropriate markup. It can be extended to handle more ligatures and
could be adapted to handle other composed characters (like the ones in
"Antonín Dvořák").

## Defective caching

**UPDATED:** _Typekit_
[improved the way fonts are served][font-serving]. It is probable that
this paragraph is now void.

[font-serving]: http://blog.typekit.com/2012/08/16/performance-improvements-to-font-serving/ "Performance improvements to font serving"

Because a document can only be rendered after the fonts have been
loaded[^fout], it is pretty important to deliver fonts as fast as
possible. _Typekit_ uses [Edgecast][edgecast] as a CDN and
[DynECT][dynect] for DNS hosting.

[^fout]: In fact, browsers have different strategies on how to
         render before fonts availability. Paul Irish wrote a
         [comprehensive article on FOUT][fout]. One common strategy is
         to render a blank space until downloaded fonts are
         available. If this takes too much time, fallback fonts may be
         used.

Two files are downloaded. Both of them are hosted on
`use.typekit.com`. The first one is a script that will act as a
loader. Based on the characteristics of your browser, it will choose
how to download the requested fonts for best rendering. The second
file is generally a big CSS file containing the fonts.

Here are the headers returned for the first file:

    ::http
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    Cache-Control: max-age=300
    Content-Encoding: gzip
    Content-Type: text/javascript
    Date: Tue, 08 Nov 2011 18:34:16 GMT
    ETag: "388467610+gzip"
    Expires: Tue, 08 Nov 2011 18:39:16 GMT
    Last-Modified: Sat, 05 Nov 2011 09:31:57 GMT
    Server: ECS (cdg/D624)
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    X-Cache: HIT
    Content-Length: 7440

First, notice that the content is served compressed. Good point. The
next headers to look at are `Cache-Control`, `Date`, `ETag` and
`Expires`: the server requests the content to be **cached for 5
minutes**. When the browser notices that its copy is out-of-date, it
will issue a new request including a `If-None-Match: 388467610+gzip`
header. Unless the kit has been modified, the server will answer
with `304 Not Modified` and no content. The copy of the browser
will be valid for another 5 minutes. This means that after 5 minutes,
at least **3 round-trips** are needed to check if our fonts are
up-to-date.

Worse, sometimes, _Typekit_ servers may be just slow. They can wait
one second before answering, just to send a `304`. Since the first file
is a script embedded in `<head>`, the whole page is blocked until you
get the answer. Here is an illustrative example with Chromium 14 where
a page using _Typekit_ is loaded while all static assets are in the
navigator cache and things have gone wrong (which is pretty rare):

![Screenshot of Chromium Inspector][typekit-slow]
[typekit-slow]: [[!!images/typekit/slow.png]] "Timeline view when loading a page with Typekit embedded"

Since fonts are needed, the rendering has been paused for 3.5 seconds
until _Typekit_ was fully loaded. If we look more closely, we may also
notice we got a status `200` from the server instead of `304`. Here is
an excerpt of the browser request:

    ::http
    GET /tyt0atd.js HTTP/1.1
    Host: use.typekit.com
    Connection: keep-alive
    Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
    If-None-Match: "2200251225+gzip"
    If-Modified-Since: Thu, 10 Nov 2011 11:38:11 GMT

And here is an excerpt of the answer headers:

    ::http
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    Cache-Control: max-age=300
    Content-Type: text/javascript
    Date: Fri, 11 Nov 2011 17:10:03 GMT
    ETag: "2200251225"
    Expires: Fri, 11 Nov 2011 17:15:03 GMT
    Last-Modified: Thu, 10 Nov 2011 11:38:11 GMT
    Server: EOS (lax001/54E5)
    Content-Length: 25755

What happened? For some unknown reason, the server denied the access
to the compressed version of the resource: there is no
`Content-Encoding: gzip` while the browser _did_ send
`Accept-Encoding: gzip`. The tag provided by the browser
(`2200251225+gzip`) came obviously from the compressed resource and
therefore does not match. [RFC 2616][rfc2616] requests
`If-Modified-Since` header to be ignored if the tag does not
match. Consequently, the server answers with `200 OK` and resend the
whole file. The same problem happened with the CSS file. Let me stress
again how important the problem is: we had to download again the two
files but we also downloaded the non-compressed version.

Now, let's suppose that we did not run into this problem and the
server answered with `304 Not Modified`. The result is still not
satisfactory: we would have waited 1.3 seconds to get both answers
from the server. Keep in mind that most of the time, _Typekit_ is
pretty fast.

Here is how I think this should have been done: each time you modify
your font kit, you get a new URL to use (containing the version of
the font kit for example). This resource and the associated fonts
(whose URL is also versioned) are requested to be cached for several
days. As a sidenote, this also enables to modify a kit for your
development environment without modifying the kit for your
production site.

I suspect that _Typekit_ did not go this way to track kit usage more
accurately and enforce the appropriate pricing. Having multiple
versions of the same kit would also allow us to use more fonts that we
are paying for.

**UPDATED:** _Typekit_ support knows the problem and is working on it:

**UPDATED:** To avoid to block page loading if _Typekit_ is slow, you
can load it [asynchronously with _yepnope.js_][asyncload]. You'll get
some FOUT instead.

# Conclusion

I have mixed feelings about _Typekit_. While the difficulty to test
fonts and the lack of language-related subsets are annoying, I have
been able to work around them. However, the caching problem is more
annoying. I am still considering going back to _Google Web Fonts_
just because of this.
