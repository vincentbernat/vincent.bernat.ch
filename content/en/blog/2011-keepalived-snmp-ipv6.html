# keepalived

[keepalived][keepalived] is an high-availability and load-balacing
solution. Using [VRRP][vrrp], it allows you to share IP addresses
between several servers or routers. At a given moment, only one of
them (the *master*) will be handed the IP address. VRRP is usually
setup for redundant routers, but you can also setup redundant
services. If the master becomes unavailable or fails, one of the
*backups* will take over the IP address. VRRP is not a cluster
resource manager. It is targeted at sharing one (or several) IP
between a set of hosts. If you want to share other resources with
complex conditions like "at least two web servers should run and the
database should not run on the same node as a web server", you should
look at [heartbeat][ha] instead.

For load-balancing, *keepalived* relies on [IPVS][ipvs], a Linux
subsystem featuring layer-4 switching. *keepalived* will check if your
servers are alive and tell it to IPVS. IPVS will handle incoming
connections and send them on the appropriate alive server depending on
the policy you can configure. For example, one policy is
*round-robin*: servers are handled new connections in circular order.

# keepalived & SNMP

*keepalived* did not feature a native SNMP support. I have added
complete SNMP support and I hope those patches will be accepted into
mainstream. Meanwhile, you can grab
[*keepalived* with SNMP support source code][source] from
GitHub. Currently, it is based on the latest version of *keepalived*.

**UPDATED:** SNMP support has been merged in _keepalived_ 1.2.5.

Here is what you can do:

 - query the configuration of the running *keepalived* without parsing
   configuration files;
 - query runtime status (like VRRP status, priority or current state
   of a virtual server) without looking in the logs;
 - query runtime statistics about virtual servers (how many
   connections were handled by this real server, for example) without
   parsing the output of `ipvsadm`;
 - get noticed with the help of SNMP traps when something changed
   (VRRP transition or a real server that became unavailable);
 - changing the priority of a VRRP instance (to force a transition as
   master);
 - changing the weight of a real server (to remove it from a pool of
   servers).

## Compilation

To use it:

    ::console
    $ git clone https://github.com/vincentbernat/keepalived.git
    $ cd keepalived
    $ git checkout snmp
    $ ./configure --enable-snmp
    $ make

You get `bin/keepalived` which is the SNMP enabled *keepalived*
daemon. You can use it directly or install it with `make install` as
root.

On RHEL, SNMP is not properly packaged. Try the following command
instead of `make`:

    ::console
    $ make LDFLAGS="$(net-snmp-config --agent-libs) -lpopt -lssl -lcrypto"

## Use

To use it, you need to ensure that your main `snmpd` daemon can become
a master agent. Check for the presence of `master agentx` line in
`snmpd.conf`. The next step is to start *keepalived* with the `-x`
switch. *keepalived* will connect to your main `snmpd` daemon. You can
check the logs for a ligne like this:

    May 28 17:21:19 L1 Keepalived_vrrp: NET-SNMP version 5.4.3 AgentX subagent connected

**UPDATED:** The interface between *keepalived* and the master agent
`snmpd` through AgentX protocol should be asynchronous. However, the
regular check of the connection is done synchronously. If the master
agent becomes unresponsive, *keepalived* will also be unresponsive
which is critical for the VRRP part. You may mitigate the problem by
[applying some workarounds][workarounds].

[workarounds]: [[en/blog/2012-fixing-async-agentx.html]] "Mitigating the not really asynchronous AgentX protocol implementation"

## Lab

To test it, we can setup a little lab with UML. You can find
additional details about this kind of lab in my post about
[network lab with UML][lab1]. Grab the
[complete lab from GitHub][lab2]. Ensure that you correct the path to
*keepalived* sources at the top of the `setup` script.

![keepalived & SNMP lab][1]

The lab features four web servers that will be merged into a single
web service with the help of *keepalived*. Since, *keepalived* now
supports full IPv6 support, we will also use IPv6 in our lab.

Here is the VRRP configuration of the first *keepalived* :

    vrrp_instance VI_1 {
       state MASTER
       interface eth2
       dont_track_primary
       track_interface {
          eth0
          eth1
       }
       virtual_router_id 1
       priority 150
       advert_int 2
       authentication {
          auth_type PASS
          auth_pass blibli
       }
       virtual_ipaddress {
          1.1.1.15/24 dev eth0
          2001:db8::15/64 dev eth0
          192.168.1.1/24 dev eth1
          fd00::1/64 dev eth1
      }
    }

We define two virtual servers, one for IPv4, one for IPv6. Here is an
excerpt of the configuration:

    virtual_server_group VS_GROUP_IPv4 {
       1.1.1.15 80
    }
    virtual_server group VS_GROUP_IPv4 {
       delay_loop 10
       lb_algo rr
       lb_kind NAT
       protocol TCP
       real_server 192.168.1.10 80 {
          weight 1
          HTTP_GET {
            url {
              path /
              status_code 200
            }
            connect_timeout 10
          }
       }
       [...]
    }

When running the lab (with `./setup`), we can check that everything
works as expected. From the client node, we can make several requests,
both with IPv4 and IPv6:

    ::console
    C1# curl  http://1.1.1.15 
    W3
    C1# curl  http://1.1.1.15
    W2
    C1# wget -o /dev/null -O - 'http://[2001:db8::15]'
    W3
    C1# wget -o /dev/null -O - 'http://[2001:db8::15]'
    W2

If we put down `eth1` on `L1`, `L2` becomes master and everything
works as expected. Our client node can still do the requests.

## SNMP

We can query the configuration of our running *keepalived* from
`L1`. The appropriate MIB is [KEEPALIVED-MIB][mib]. The base OID for
this MIB is `.1.3.6.1.4.1.9586.100.5`. It is hosted in the
[OID space allocated by IANA to the Debian project][oid].

For example, to get the configuration of our VRRP instance:

    ::console
    # snmpwalk -v2c -cpublic localhost KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceTable
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceName.1 = STRING: VI_1
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceVirtualRouterId.1 = Gauge32: 1
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceState.1 = INTEGER: master(2)
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceInitialState.1 = INTEGER: master(2)
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceWantedState.1 = INTEGER: master(2)
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceBasePriority.1 = INTEGER: 150
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceEffectivePriority.1 = INTEGER: 150
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceVipsStatus.1 = INTEGER: allSet(1)
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstancePrimaryInterface.1 = STRING: eth2
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceTrackPrimaryIf.1 = INTEGER: tracked(1)
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceAdvertisementsInt.1 = Gauge32: 2 seconds
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstancePreempt.1 = INTEGER: preempt(1)
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstancePreemptDelay.1 = Gauge32: 0 seconds
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceAuthType.1 = INTEGER: password(1)
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceLvsSyncDaemon.1 = INTEGER: disabled(2)
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceGarpDelay.1 = Gauge32: 0 seconds
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceSmtpAlert.1 = INTEGER: disabled(2)
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::vrrpInstanceNotifyExec.1 = INTEGER: disabled(2)

We can get statistics from IPVS subsystem:

    ::console
    # snmpwalk -v 2c -c public localhost KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerTable | grep Stats
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerStatsConns.1 = Gauge32: 6 connections
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerStatsConns.2 = Gauge32: 6 connections
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerStatsInPkts.1 = Counter32: 36 packets
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerStatsInPkts.2 = Counter32: 36 packets
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerStatsOutPkts.1 = Counter32: 24 packets
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerStatsOutPkts.2 = Counter32: 24 packets
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerStatsInBytes.1 = Counter64: 2970 bytes
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerStatsInBytes.2 = Counter64: 3312 bytes
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerStatsOutBytes.1 = Counter64: 2592 bytes
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::virtualServerStatsOutBytes.2 = Counter64: 3072 bytes

We can also disable a real server, for example `W1`:

    ::console
    # snmpget -v2c -cpublic localhost KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerAddrType.1.1 \
                                    KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerAddress.1.1
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerAddrType.1.1 = INTEGER: ipv4(1)
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerAddress.1.1 = Hex-STRING: C0 A8 01 0A 
    # snmpget -v2c -cpublic localhost KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerAddress.2.1 \
                                    KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerAddress.2.1
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerAddress.2.1 = Hex-STRING: FD 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerAddress.2.1 = Hex-STRING: FD 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 
    # snmpset -v2c -cprivate localhost KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerWeight.1.1 = 0
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerWeight.1.1 = INTEGER: 0
    # snmpset -v2c -cprivate localhost KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerWeight.2.1 = 0
    KEEPALIVED-MIB::realServerWeight.2.1 = INTEGER: 0

From `C1`, you can now check that `W1` is not queried anymore.

Let's graph the number of connections per second each real server
gets. With a [simple script using `rrdtool`][rrd], we can get the
following graph:
