I have happily [used FVWM][] as my window manager for more than 10
years. However, I recently got tired of manually arranging windows and
using the mouse so much. A window manager is one of the handful pieces
of software getting in your way at every moment which explains why
there are so many of them and why we might put so much time in it.

I decided to try a [tiling window manager][]. While [i3][] seemed
pretty hot and powerful (watch the [screencast][i3 screencast]!), I
really wanted something configurable and extensible with some
language. So far, the common choices are:

 - [awesome][], written in C, configurable and extensible in [Lua][],
 - [StumpWM][], written, configurable and extensible in [Common Lisp][],
 - [xmonad][], written, configurable and extensible in [Haskell][].
 
I chose _awesome_, despite the fact that _StumpWM_ vote for Lisp
seemed a better fit (but it is more minimalist). I hope there is some
parallel universe where I enjoy _StumpWM_.

Visually, here is what I got so far:

# Awesome configuration

Without a configuration file, _awesome_ does nothing. It does not come
with any hard-coded behavior: **everything needs to be configured**
through its _Lua_ configuration file. Of course, a default one is
provided but you can also start from scratch. If you like to control
your window manager, this is somewhat wonderful.

_awesome_ is well documented. The [wiki][] provides a [FAQ][], a
[good introduction][] and the [API reference][] is concise enough to
be read from the top to the bottom. Knowing _Lua_ is not mandatory since
it is quite easy to dive into such a language.

I have posted my configuration on [GitHub][]. It should not be used as
is but some snippets may be worth to be stolen and adapted into your
own configuration. The following sections put light on some notable
points.

## Keybindings

Ten years ago was the epoch of scavanger hunts to recover
[IBM Model M keyboards][] from waste containers. They were great to
type on and they did not feature the infamous Windows keys. Nowadays,
this is harder to get such a keyboard. All my keyboards now have
Windows keys. This is a major change with respect to configure a
window manager: the left Windows key is mapped to `Mod4` and is
usually unused by most applications and can therefore be dedicated to
the window manager.

The main problem with the ability to define many keybindings is to
remember the less frequently used one. I have monkey-patched
`awful.key` module to be able to attach a documentation string to a
keybinding. I have documented the whole process on the
[_awesome_ wiki][keydoc-wiki].

![awesome online help][help]
[help]: [[!!images/awesome/keybindings.jpg]] "Contextual help for available keybindings"

[keydoc-wiki]: http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Document_keybindings "Documenting keybindings in awesome wiki"

## Quake console

A _Quake console_ is a drop-down terminal which can be toggled with
some key. I was heavily relying on it in FVWM. I think this is still a
useful addition to any _awesome_ configuration. There are several
possible solutions documented in the [_awesome_ wiki][quake-wiki]. I
have added my own[^own] which works great for me.

![Quake console][quake]
[quake]: [[!!images/awesome/quake.jpg]] "Quake console at the top of the screen"

[quake-wiki]: http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Drop-down_terminal "Drop-down terminal on awesome wiki"

[^own]: The console gets its own unique name. This allows _awesome_ to
        reliably detect when it is spawned, even on restart. It is how
        the Quake console works in the _mod_ of FVWM I was using.

## XRandR

XRandR is an extension which allows to dynamically reconfigure
outputs: you plug an external screen to your laptop and you issue
some command to enable it:

    ::console
    $ xrandr --output VGA-1 --auto --left-of LVDS-1

_awesome_ detects the change and will restart automatically. Laptops
usually come with a special key to enable/disable an external
screen. Nowadays, this key does nothing unless configured
appropriately. Out of the box, it is mapped to `XF86Display` symbol. I
have associated this key to a function that will
[cycle through possible configurations][xrandr] depending on the
plugged screens. For example, if I plug an external screen to my
laptop, I can cycle through the following configurations:

 - only the internal screen,
 - only the external screen,
 - internal screen on the left, external screen on the right,
 - external screen on the left, internal screen on the right,
 - no change.

The proposed configuration is displayed using _naughty_, the
notification system integrated in _awesome_.

## Widgets

I was previously using [Conky][] to display various system-related
information, like free space, CPU usage and network usage. _awesome_
comes with widgets that can fit the same use. I am relying on
_vicious_, a contributed widget manager, to manage most of them. It
allows one to attach a function whose task is to fetch values to be
displayed. This is quite powerful.

Here is an example with a volume widget:

    ::lua
    local volwidget = widget({ type = "textbox" })
    vicious.register(volwidget, vicious.widgets.volume,
             '<span font="Terminus 8">$2 $1%</span>',
            2, "Master")
    volwidget:buttons(awful.util.table.join(
                 awful.button({ }, 1, volume.mixer),
                 awful.button({ }, 3, volume.toggle),
                 awful.button({ }, 4, volume.increase),
                 awful.button({ }, 5, volume.decrease)))

You can also use a function to format the text as you wish. For
example, you can display a value in red if it is too low. Have a look
at my [battery widget][] for an example.

# Miscellaneous

While I was working on my _awesome_ configuration, I also changed some
other desktop-related bits.

## Keyboard configuration

I happen to setup all my keyboards to use the QWERTY layout. I use a
[compose key][] to input special characters like "é". I have also
recently use _Caps Lock_ as a _Control_ key. All this is perfectly
supported since ages by X11 I am also mapping the _Pause_ key to
`XF86ScreenSaver` key symbol which will in turn be bound to a function
that will trigger `xautolock` to lock the screen.

Thanks to a great article about
[extending the X keyboard map with _xkb_][extend-xkb], I discovered
that X was able to switch from one layout to another using
groups[^perwindow]. I finally opted for this simple configuration:

    ::console
    $ setxkbmap us,fr '' compose:rwin ctrl:nocaps grp:rctrl_rshift_toggle
    $ xmodmap -e 'keysym Pause = XF86ScreenSaver'

I switch from `us` to `fr` by pressing both left _Control_ and left
_Shift_ keys.

[^perwindow]: However, the layout is global, not per-window. If you
              are interested by a per-window layout, take a look at
              [kbdd][].

## Getting rid of most GNOME stuff

Less than one year ago, to take a step forward to the future, I
started to [heavily rely on some GNOME components][gnome] like _GNOME
Display Manager_, _GNOME Power Manager_, the screen saver,
`gnome-session`, `gnome-settings-daemon` and others. I had numerous
problems when I tried to setup everything without pulling the whole
GNOME stack. At each GNOME update, something was broken: the
screensaver didn't start automatically anymore until a full session
restart or some keybindings were randomly hijacked by
`gnome-settings-daemon`.

Therefore, I have decided to get rid of most of those components. I
have replaced _GNOME Power Manager_ with system-level tools like
_sleepd_ and the PM utilities. I replaced the GNOME screensaver with
[i3lock][] and _xautolock_. _GDM_ has been replaced by [SLiM][] which
now features _ConsoleKit_ support[^consolekit]. I use `~/.gtkrc-2.0`
and `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` to configure GTK+.

The future will wait.

[^consolekit]: Nowadays, you cannot really survive without
               _ConsoleKit_. Many _PolicyKit_ policies do not rely on
               groups any more to grant access to your devices.

## Terminal color scheme

I am using [rxvt-unicode][] as my terminal with a black background
(and some light transparency). The default color scheme is suboptimal
on the readability front.

Sharing terminal color schemes seems a [popular][rxvt color scheme]
[activity][xcolors.net]. I finally opted for the
["_derp_" color scheme][derp] which brings a major improvement over the
default configuration.

![Comparison of terminal color schemes][term-colors]
[term-colors]: [[!!images/awesome/terminal-colors.png]] "Comparison of the default color scheme (bottom) with the new one (top)"

I have also switched to Xft for font rendering using _DejaVu Sans
Mono_ as my default font (instead of `fixed`) with the following
configuration in `~/.Xresources`:

    ::
    Xft.antialias: true
    Xft.hinting: true
    Xft.hintstyle: hintlight
    Xft.rgba: rgb
    URxvt.font: xft:DejaVu Sans Mono-8
    URxvt.letterSpace: -1

The result is less crisp but seems a bit more readable. I may switch
back in the future.

# Next steps

My reliance to the mouse has been greatly reduced. However, I still
need it for casual browsing. I am looking at [luakit][] a
_WebKit_-based browser extensible with _Lua_ for this purpose.
