I have been using the [awesome window manager][] for 10 years. It is a
[tiling window manager][], configurable and extendable with the
[Lua][] language. Using a general-purpose programming language to
configure every aspect is a double-edged sword. Due to laziness and
the apparent difficulty of adapting [my configuration][awesome
config]â€”about 3000 linesâ€”to newer releases, I was stuck with the 3.4
version, whose last release is from 2013.

It was time for a rewrite. Instead, I have switched to the [i3 window
manager][], lured by the possibility to migrate to [Wayland][] and
[Sway][] later with minimal pain. Using an embedded interpreter for
configuration is not as important to me as it was in the past: it
brings both complexity and brittleness.

[![i3 dual screen setup]([[!!images/i3/desktop@2x.jpg]] "Dual screen
desktop running i3, Emacs, some terminals, including a Quake
console, Firefox, Polybar as the status bar, and Dunst as the
notification daemon.")]([[!!images/i3/desktop@2x.jpg]])

The window manager is only one part of a desktop environment. There
are several options for the other components. I am also introducing
them in this post.

[TOC]

# i3: the window manager

*i3* aims to be a minimal tiling window manager. Its [documentation][]
can be read from top to bottom in less than an hour. *i3* organize
windows in a [tree][]. Each non-leaf node contains one or several
windows and has an orientation and a layout. This information
arbitrates the window positions. *i3* features three layouts: split,
stacking, and tabbed. They are demonstrated in the below screenshot:

![Example of layouts]([[!!images/i3/layouts@2x.jpg]] "Demonstration of
the layouts available in i3. The main container is split
horizontally. The first child is split vertically. The second one
is tabbed. The last one is stacking.")

![Tree representation of the previous
screenshot]([[!!images/i3/layouts.svg]] "Tree representation of the
previous screenshot.")

Most of the other tiling window managers, including the *awesome
window manager*, use predefined layouts. They usually feature a large
area for the main window and another area divided among the remaining
windows. These layouts can be tuned a bit, but you mostly stick to a
couple of them. When a new window is added, the behavior is quite
predictable. Moreover, you can cycle through the various windows
without thinking too much as they are ordered.

*i3* is more flexible with its ability to build any layout on the fly,
it can feel quite overwhelming as you need to visualize the tree in
your head. At first, it is not unusual to find yourself with a complex
tree with many useless nested containers. Moreover, you have to
navigate windows using directions. It takes some time to get used to.

I set up a split layout for Emacs and a few terminals, but most of the
other workspaces are using a tabbed layout. I don't use the stacking
layout. You can find many scripts trying to emulate other tiling
window managers but I did try to get my setup pristine of these
tentatives and get a chance to familiarize myself. *i3* can also [save
and restore layouts][], which is quite a powerful feature.

[My configuration][i3cfg] is quite similar to the default one and has
less than 200 lines.

# i3 companion: the missing bits

*i3* philosophy is to keep a minimal core and let the user implements
missing features using the IPC protocol:

> Do not add further complexity when it can be avoided. We are
> generally happy with the feature set of i3 and instead focus on
> fixing bugs and maintaining it for stability. New features will
> therefore only be considered if the benefit outweighs the additional
> complexity, and we encourage users to implement features using the
> IPC whenever possible.
>
> â€” [Introduction to the i3 window manager][i3 window manager]

While this is not as powerful as an embedded language, it is enough
for many cases. Moreover, as high-level features may be opinionated,
delegating them to small, loosely coupled pieces of code keeps them
more maintainable. Libraries exist for this purpose in [several
languages][]. Users have published many scripts to extend *i3*:
[automatic layout][] and [window promotion][] to mimic the behavior
of other tiling window managers, [window swallowing][] to put a new
app on top of the terminal launching it, and [cycling between
windows][] with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.

Instead of maintaining a script for each feature, I have centralized
everything into a single Python process,
[`i3-companion`][i3-companion] using [asyncio][] and the
[i3ipc-python][] library. Each feature is self-contained into a
function. It implements the following components:

Make a workspace exclusive to an application
: When a workspace contains Emacs or Firefox, I would like other
  applications to move to another workspace, except for the terminal
  which is allowed to "intrude" into any workspace. The
  `workspace_exclusive()` function monitors new windows and moves them
  if needed to an empty workspace or to one with the same application
  already running.

Implement a Quake console
: The `quake_console()` function implements a drop-down console
  available from any workspace. It can be toggled with
  <kbd>Mod</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd>. This is implemented as a [scratchpad
  window][].

Back and forth workspace switching on the same output
: With the `workspace back_and_forth` command, we can ask *i3* to
  switch to the previous workspace. However, this feature is not
  restricted to the current output. I prefer to have one keybinding to
  switch to the workspace on the next output and one keybinding to
  switch to the previous workspace on the same output. This behavior
  is implemented in the `previous_workspace()` function by keeping a
  per-output history of the focused workspaces.

Create a new empty workspace or move a window to an empty workspace
: To create a new empty workspace or move a window to an empty
  workspace, you have to locate a free slot and use `workspace number
  4` or `move container to workspace number 4`. The `new_workspace()`
  function finds a free number and use it as the target workspace.

Restart some services on output change
: When adding or removing an output, some actions need to be executed:
  refresh the wallpaper, restart some components unable to adapt their
  configuration on their own, etc. *i3* triggers an event for this
  purpose. The `output_update()` function also takes an extra step to
  coalesce multiple consecutive events and to check if there is a real
  change with the low-level library [xcffib][].

I will detail the other features as this post goes on. On the
technical side, each function is decorated with the events it should
react to:

    ::python
    @on(CommandEvent("previous-workspace"), I3Event.WORKSPACE_FOCUS)
    async def previous_workspace(i3, event):
        """Go to previous workspace on the same output."""

The `CommandEvent()` event class is my way to send a command to the
companion, using either `i3-msg -t send_tick` or binding a key to a
`nop` command. The latter is used to avoid spawning a shell and a
`i3-msg` process just to send a message. The companion listens to
binding events and checks if this is a `nop` command.

    bindsym $mod+Tab nop "previous-workspace"

There are other decorators to avoid code duplication: `@debounce()` to
coalesce multiple consecutive calls, `@static()` to define a static
variable, and `@retry()` to retry a function on failure. The [whole
script][i3-companion] is a bit more than 1000 lines. I think this is
worth a read as I am quite happy with the result. ðŸ¦š

# dunst: the notification daemon

Unlike the awesome window manager, *i3* does not come with a built-in
notification system. [Dunst][] is a lightweight notification daemon. I
am running a modified version with [HiDPI support for X11][] and
[recursive icon lookup][]. The *i3 companion* has a helper function,
`notify()`, to send notifications using DBus. `container_info()` and
`workspace_info()` uses it to display information about the container
or the tree for a workspace.

![Notification showing i3 tree for a
workspace]([[!!images/i3/workspace-info@2x.jpg]] "Notification showing
i3â€™s tree for a workspace")

# polybar: the status bar

*i3* bundles [i3bar][], a versatile status bar, but I have opted for
[Polybar][]. A [wrapper script][polybar script] runs one instance for
each monitor.

The first module is the built-in support for *i3* workspaces. To not
have to remember which application is running in a workspace, the *i3
companion* renames workspaces to include an icon for each application.
This is done in the `workspace_rename()` function. The icons are from
the [Font Awesome][] project. I maintain a mapping between applications
and icons. This is a bit cumbersome but it looks great.

![i3 workspaces in Polybar]([[!!images/i3/workspaces@2x.png]] "i3
workspaces in Polybar")

For CPU, memory, brightness, battery, disk, and audio volume, I am
relying on the built-in modules. Polybar's [wrapper script][polybar
script] generates the list of filesystems to monitor and they get only
displayed when available space is low. The battery widget turns red
and blinks slowly when running out of power. Check my [Polybar
configuration][] for more details.

![Various modules for Polybar]([[!!images/i3/polybar@2x.png]] "Polybar
displaying various information: CPU usage, memory usage, screen
brightness, battery status, Bluetooth status (with a connected
headset), network status (connected to a wireless network and to a
VPN), notification status, and speaker volume.")

For Bluetooh, network, and notification statuses, I am using Polybar's
[`ipc` module][ipc module]: the next version of *Polybar* can [receive
an arbitrary text on an IPC socket][]. The module is defined with a
single hook to be executed at the start to restore the latest status.

    ::ini
    [module/network]
    type = custom/ipc
    hook-0 = cat $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/i3/network.txt 2> /dev/null
    initial = 1

It can be updated with `polybar-msg action "#network.send.XXXX"`. In
the *i3 companion*, the `@polybar()` decorator takes the string
returned by a function and pushes the update through the IPC socket.

The *i3 companion* reacts to DBus signals to update the Bluetooth and
network icons. The `@on()` decorator accepts a `DBusSignal()` object:

    ::python
    @on(
        StartEvent,
        DBusSignal(
            path="/org/bluez",
            interface="org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties",
            member="PropertiesChanged",
            signature="sa{sv}as",
            onlyif=lambda args: (
                args[0] == "org.bluez.Device1"
                and "Connected" in args[1]
                or args[0] == "org.bluez.Adapter1"
                and "Powered" in args[1]
            ),
        ),
    )
    @retry(2)
    @debounce(0.2)
    @polybar("bluetooth")
    async def bluetooth_status(i3, event, *args):
        """Update bluetooth status for Polybar."""

The middle of the bar is occupied by the date and a weather forecast.
The latest also uses the IPC mechanism, but the source is a [Python
script][polybar-weather] triggered by a timer.

![Date and weather in Polybar]([[!!images/i3/weather@2x.png]] "Current
date and weather forecast for the day in Polybar. The data is
retrieved with the OpenWeather API.")

I don't use the *system tray* integrated with *Polybar*. The embedded
icons usually look horrible and they all behave differently. A few
years back, [Gnome has removed the system tray][]. Most of the
problems are fixed by the DBus-based [Status Notifier Item
protocol][]â€”also known as [Application Indicators][] or [Ayatana
Indicators][] for GNOME. However, [*Polybar* does not support this
protocol][]. In the *i3 companion*, The implementation of Bluetooth
and network icons, including the notifications on change, takes
about 200 lines. I got to learn a bit about how DBus works and I get exactly
the info I want.

# picom: the compositor

I like having slightly transparent backgrounds for terminals and to
reduce the opacity of unfocused windows. This requires a
compositor.[^tearfree] [picom][] is a lightweight compositor. It works
well for me, but it may need some tweaking depending on your graphic
card.[^intel] Unlike the awesome window manager, *i3* does not handle
transparency, so the compositor needs to decide by itself the opacity
of each window. Check my [configuration][picom config] for details.

[^tearfree]: Apart from the eye candy, a compositor also helps to get
    tear-free video playbacks.

[^intel]: My configuration works with both Haswell (2014) and Whiskey
    Lake (2018) Intel GPUs. It also works with AMD GPU based on the
    Polaris chipset (2017).

# systemd: the service manager

I use [systemd][] to start *i3* and the various services around it. My
[xsession script][] only sets some environment variables and lets
*systemd* handles everything else. Have a look at [this article from
MichaÅ‚ GÃ³ral][] for the rationale. Notably, each component can be
easily restarted and their logs are not mangled inside the
`~/.xsession-errors` file.[^limitation]

[^limitation]: You cannot manage two different displays this wayâ€”e.g.
    `:0` and `:1`. In the first implementation, I did try to
    parametrize each service with the associated display, but this is
    useless: there is only one DBus user session and many services
    rely on it. For example, you cannot run two notification daemons.

I am using a two-stage setup: [`i3.service`][i3.service] depends on
[`xsession.target`][xsession.target] to start services before
*i3*:

    ::ini
    [Unit]
    Description=X session
    BindsTo=graphical-session.target
    Wants=autorandr.service
    Wants=dunst.socket
    Wants=inputplug.service
    Wants=picom.service
    Wants=pulseaudio.socket
    Wants=policykit-agent.service
    Wants=redshift.service
    Wants=spotify-clean.timer
    Wants=ssh-agent.service
    Wants=xiccd.service
    Wants=xsettingsd.service
    Wants=xss-lock.service

Then, *i3* executes the second stage by invoking the
[`i3-session.target`][i3-session.target]:

    ::ini
    [Unit]
    Description=i3 session
    BindsTo=graphical-session.target
    Wants=wallpaper.service
    Wants=wallpaper.timer
    Wants=polybar-weather.service
    Wants=polybar-weather.timer
    Wants=polybar.service
    Wants=i3-companion.service
    Wants=misc-x.service

Have a look on my [configuration files][systemd config] for more
details.

# rofi: the application launcher

[Rofi][] is an application launcher. Its appearance can be customized
through a CSS-like language and it comes with several themes. Have a
look at my [configuration][rofi config] for mine.

![Rofi as an application launcher]([[!!images/i3/rofi-drun@2x.jpg]]
"Rofi as an application launcher")

It can also act as a generic menu application. I have a script
to [control a media player][rofi-mediaplayer] and another one to
[select the wifi network][rofi-wifi]. It is quite a flexible
application.

![Rofi as a wifi network selector]([[!!images/i3/rofi-wifi@2x.jpg]]
"Rofi to select a wireless network")

# xss-lock and i3lock: the screen locker

[i3lock][] is a simple screen locker. [xss-lock][] invokes it reliably
on inactivity or before a system suspend. For inactivity, it uses the
[XScreenSaver events][]. The delay is configured using the `xset s`
command. The locker can be invoked immediately with `xset s activate`.
X11 applications know how to prevent the screen saver from running. I
have also developed a small [dimmer application][] that is executed 20
seconds before the locker to give me a chance to move the mouse if I
am not away.[^dimmer] Have a look at my [configuration
script][xss-lock config].

![xss-lock, xss-dimmer and i3lock in action]([[!!images/i3/locker.mp4]]
"Demonstration of xss-lock, xss-dimmer and i3lock with a 4Ã— speedup.")

[^dimmer]: I have only discovered later that [XSecureLock][] ships
    such a dimmer with a similar implementation. But mine has a cool
    countdown! Optionally, it can also fade to a background image.

!!! "Update (2021-12)" I am now using [XSecureLock][] with a [Python
script][xsecurelock-saver] to customize the look of the screensaver.
It includes a lock and a weather widget.

# The remaining components

- [autorandr][] is a tool to detect the connected display, match them
  against a set of profiles, and configure them with `xrandr`.

- [inputplug][] executes a script for each new mouse and keyboard
  plugged. This is quite useful to load the appropriate the [keyboard
  map][]. See my [configuration][inputplug config].

- [xsettingsd][] provides settings to X11 applications, not unlike
  [xrdb][] but it notifies applications for changes. The main use is
  to configure the Gtk and DPI settings. See my article on [HiDPI
  support on Linux with X11][].

- [Redshift][] adjusts the color temperature of the screen according
  to the time of day.

- [maim][] is a utility to take screenshots. I use <kbd>Prt Scn</kbd>
  to trigger a screenshot of a window or a specific area and
  <kbd>Mod</kbd>+<kbd>Prt Scn</kbd> to capture the whole desktop to a
  file. Check the [helper script][maim script] for details.

- I have a collection of wallpapers I rotate every hour. A
  [script][wallpaper] selects them using advanced machine learning
  algorithms and stitches them together on multi-screen setups. The
  selected wallpaper is reused by *i3lock*.
