Here is a replay as a screencast[^voice] of a presentation I did for
[dotScale 2015][]. It is a demonstration of [Docker Swarm][], a
cluster of Docker hosts, and *Docker Machine*, a defunct product to
deploy Docker in the cloud, with its integration with [Exoscale][].

[^voice]: This is not my voice, but Stefano's!

And here is a nice photo taken during the live demo!
