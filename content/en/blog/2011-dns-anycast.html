In a recently published article, Paul Vixie, past author and
architect of [BIND][bind], one of the most popular internet domain
server, [explains why DNS servers should use anycast][paulvixie] for
increased reliability and faster answers. The main argument against
unicast is that some resolvers may not be smart enough to select the
best server to query and therefore, they may select a server on the
other side of the planet. Since, you cannot go faster than light,
you get a penalty of about 100 milliseconds in this case.

[TOC]

# Unicast & anycast

Most addresses that you handle are *unicast* addresses, i.e. the
address of a single receiver. Any time you send a packet to an
unicast address, it will be forwarded to this single receiver. Another
common network addressing system is *multicast* (which happens to
include *broadcast*). When you send a packet to a multicast address,
several receivers may get it. The packet is copied as needed by some
nodes.

*Anycast* addresses allow you to send a packet to a set of receivers
but only one of them will receive it. The packet will not be
copied. Usually, the idea behind anycast is that the packet is sent
to the nearest receiver.

There is no universal way to determine if an IP address is an unicast address or
an anycast address just by looking at it. For example `192.5.5.241` is
an anycast address while `78.47.78.132` is an unicast address.

ISC, which maintains BIND, operates the "F" root domain server, one of
the 13 Internet [root name servers][rootservers]. This server is
queried by using `192.5.5.241` IPv4 anycast address or
`2001:500:2f::f` IPv6 anycast address. ISC has published a
[document explaining how anycast works][anycast]. Several nodes around
the globe announces the same subnet using BGP. When one router running
BGP has to send a query to the anycast address, it will have several
choices in its BGP table. It will usually select the shortest path and
route the query to the corresponding router.

Some nodes may choose to restrict the announcement about the subnet
containing the anycast address. They are called local nodes (by
opposition to other global nodes). This allows them to serve query
only from their clients and use cheaper connectivity and hardware.

# Lab

Let's play with anycast by setting up a lab to experiment with it. We
want to setup an IPv6 anycast DNS service using two global nodes, `G1`
and `G2`, and one local node, `L1`. We build some kind of
mini-Internet. See:

![Anycast lab][1]
[1]: [[!!images/anycast-lab.png]] "Topology for anycast DNS lab"

## Setting up the lab

This lab will use UML guests for all nodes. For more details on how
this works, look at my
[previous article about network labs with User Mode Linux][umllab]. You
first need to grab the lab:

    ::console
    $ git clone https://vincentbernat@github.com/vincentbernat/network-lab.git
    $ cd network-lab/lab-anycast-dns
    $ ./setup

You will need to install the dependencies needed by the script on your
host system. The script was tested on Debian unstable. If some of the
dependencies do not exist in your distribution, if they don't behave
as in Debian or if you don't want to install them on your host system,
you can use `debootstrap` to create a working system:

    ::console
    $ sudo debootstrap sid ./sid-chroot http://ftp.debian.org/debian/
    [...]
    $ sudo chroot ./sid-chroot /bin/bash
    # apt-get install iproute zsh aufs-tools
    [...]
    # apt-get install bird6
    [...]
    # exit
    $ sudo mkdir -p ./sid-chroot/$HOME
    $ sudo chown $(whoami) ./sid-chroot/$HOME
    $ ROOT=./sid-chroot ./setup

We are running a lot of UML guests in this lab. We assign 64 MB to
each host. UML guests do not use host memory until they need it but
because of cache subsystem, you can expect that each guest will use 64
MB of memory. This means that you need about 2 GB of RAM to run this
lab. Moreover, each guest will create a file representing its
memory. Therefore, you need about 2 GB of free space in `/tmp` too.

Routers are named after their AS number. The router of AS 64652 is
just `64652`. `Paris`, `NewYork` and `Tokyo` are the exception.

The lab will use only one switch but we will use VLAN to create
several L2 networks. Each link in our schema is an L2 network. Each
link will get its own L3 network. Those networks are prefixed with
`2001:db8:ffff:`. Leaf AS have their own L3 network `2001:db8:X::/48`
where `X` is the AS number minus 60000. Look at `/etc/hosts` on each
host to get the IP of all hosts.

## Mini-Internet routing

AS 64600 is some kind of Tier-1 transit network (like
[Level 3 Communications][level3]). It has three points of presence:
Paris, New York and Tokyo. AS 64650 is an European regional transit
network, AS 64640 is an East Asian regional transit network and AS
64610, 64620 and 64630 are North American regional transit network which are
peering each other. Other leaf AS are local ISP.

This is not really what Internet looks like but shaping our lab like a
tree allows us to not deal with a lot of BGP stuff: we ensure that the
shortest path (in number of BGP hops) from one client to one server is
the best path. Each BGP router will get a basic BGP configuration
containing only the list of peers. Since `Paris`, `Tokyo` and
`NewYork` are in the same AS, they will use iBGP. They are fully
meshed for this purpose but this does not provide redundancy because
iBGP routes are not redistributed inside iBGP. A more complex setup
would be needed to provide redundancy inside AS 64600. We don't use an
IGP inside leaf AS as we should: for the sake of simplicity, we
redistribute directly connected routes into BGP.

While in my [previous lab][umllab], I used Quagga, I will use
[BIRD][bird] in this one. It is a more modern daemon with a clean
design on how routing tables may interact. It also performs
better. However, it lacks several features from Quagga. The
configuration for BIRD is autogenerated from `/etc/hosts`. We use only
one routing table inside BIRD. This table will be exported to the
kernel and to any BGP instance. Some directly connected routes will be
imported (those representing client networks) as well as all routes
from BGP instances. Here is an excerpt of `64610`'s configuration:

    protocol direct {
       description "Client networks";
       import filter {
         if net ~ [ 2001:db8:4600::/40{40,48} ] then accept;
         reject;
       };
       export none;
    }

    protocol kernel {
       persist;
       import none;
       export all;
    }

    protocol bgp {
       description "BGP with peer NewYork";
       local as 64610;
       neighbor 2001:db8:ffff:4600:4610::1 as 64600;
       gateway direct;
       hold time 30;
       export all;
       import all;
    }

We do not export inter-router subnets to keep our routing tables
small. This also means that those IP addresses are not routable in
spite of the use of public IP addresses. Here is the routing table as
seen by `64610` (use `birdc6` to connect to BIRD):

    bird> show route
    2001:db8:4622::/48 via 2001:db8:ffff:4610:4620::2 on eth3 [bgp4 18:52] * (100) [AS64622i]
                       via 2001:db8:ffff:4600:4610::1 on eth0 [bgp1 18:52] (100) [AS64622i]
    2001:db8:4621::/48 via 2001:db8:ffff:4610:4620::2 on eth3 [bgp4 18:52] * (100) [AS64621i]
                       via 2001:db8:ffff:4600:4610::1 on eth0 [bgp1 18:52] (100) [AS64621i]
    2001:db8:4612::/48 via 2001:db8:ffff:4610:4612::2 on eth2 [bgp3 18:52] * (100) [AS64612i]
    2001:db8:4611::/48 via 2001:db8:ffff:4610:4611::2 on eth1 [bgp2 18:52] * (100) [AS64611i]

As you can notice, it knows several paths to the same network,
however, it only selects the best one (based on the length of the AS
path):

    bird> show route 2001:db8:4622::/48 all
    2001:db8:4622::/48 via 2001:db8:ffff:4610:4620::2 on eth3 [bgp4 18:52] * (100) [AS64622i]
            Type: BGP unicast univ
            BGP.origin: IGP
            BGP.as_path: 64620 64622
            BGP.next_hop: 2001:db8:ffff:4610:4620::2 fe80::e05f:a3ff:fef2:f4e0
            BGP.local_pref: 100
                       via 2001:db8:ffff:4600:4610::1 on eth0 [bgp1 18:52] (100) [AS64622i]
            Type: BGP unicast univ
            BGP.origin: IGP
            BGP.as_path: 64600 64620 64622
            BGP.next_hop: 2001:db8:ffff:4600:4610::1 fe80::3426:63ff:fe5e:afbd
            BGP.local_pref: 100

Let's check that everything works with `traceroute6` on `C1`:

    ::console
    # traceroute6 G2.lab
    traceroute to G2.lab (2001:db8:4612::2:53), 30 hops max, 80 byte packets
     1  64652-eth1.lab (2001:db8:4652::1)  -338.277 ms  -338.449 ms  -338.502 ms

     5  64610-eth0.lab (2001:db8:ffff:4600:4610::2)  -338.078 ms  -337.958 ms  -337.944 ms
     6  64612-eth0.lab (2001:db8:ffff:4610:4612::2)  -337.778 ms  -338.103 ms  -338.041 ms
     7  G2.lab (2001:db8:4612::2:53)  -338.001 ms  -338.045 ms  -338.080 ms

Let's see what happens if we shut the link between `NewYork` and
`64610`. This link is VLAN 10. Since `vde_switch` does not allow us to
shut a port, we will change the VLAN of port 9 to VLAN 4093. After at
most 30 seconds, the BGP session between `NewYork` and `64610` will be
torn down and packets from `C1` to `G2` will take a new path:

    ::console
    # traceroute6 G2.lab
    traceroute to G2.lab (2001:db8:4612::2:53), 30 hops max, 80 byte packets
     1  64652-eth1.lab (2001:db8:4652::1)  -338.382 ms  -338.499 ms  -338.503 ms

## Setting up anycast DNS

Our anycast DNS service has three nodes. Two global ones, located in
Europe and North America and one local one targeted at customers of
AS 64620 only. The IP address of this anycast DNS server is
`2001:db8:aaaa::53/48`. We assign this address to `G1`, `G2` and
`L1`. We also assign `2001:db8:aaaa::1/48` to `64651`, `64612` and
`64621`. BIRD configuration is adapted to advertise this network:

    protocol direct {
       description "Client networks";
       import filter {
         if net ~ [ 2001:db8:4600::/40{40,48} ] then accept;
         if net ~ [ 2001:db8:aaaa::/48 ] then accept;
         reject;
       };
       export none;
    }

We use [NSD][nsd] as a name server. This is an authoritative only name
server. The configuration is pretty simple. We just ensure that it is
bound to the IPv6 anycast address (otherwise, it may answer with the
wrong address). The zone file is customized to answer the name of the
server:

    ::console
    #(C1) host -t TXT example.com 2001:db8:aaaa::53
    Using domain server:
    Name: 2001:db8:aaaa::53
    Address: 2001:db8:aaaa::53#53
    Aliases: 

    example.com descriptive text "G1"
    #(C5) host -t TXT example.com 2001:db8:aaaa::53
    Using domain server:
    Name: 2001:db8:aaaa::53
    Address: 2001:db8:aaaa::53#53
    Aliases: 

    example.com descriptive text "G2"

If we try from `C3`, we may be redirected to `L1` while we are not a
customer of AS 64620. A common way to handle this is to let `64621`
tag the route with a special community that will let know `64620` that
the route should not be exported.

    protocol direct {
       description "Client networks";
       import filter {
         if net ~ [ 2001:db8:4600::/40{40,48} ] then accept;
         if net ~ [ 2001:db8:aaaa::/48 ] then {
              bgp_community.add((65535,65281));
              accept;
         }
         reject;
       };
       export none;
    }

The community used is known as the `no-export` community. BIRD knows
how to handle it. However, we hit here some limitations of BIRD:

  1. The correct way to let `64622` knows about this route is to build
  a BGP confederation for AS 64620 and let AS 64622 and AS 64621 be
  part of it. This means that those three AS will be seen as AS 64200
  from outside of the confederation. Moreover, the `no-export`
  community would allow us to export the route only within the
  confederation. This is exactly what we need but BIRD does not
  support confederations.
  
  2. BIRD first selects the best route to export then apply
  filtering. This means that even if `64620` knows non-filtered route
  to `2001:db8:aaaa::/48`, it will select the route to `L1`, filter it
  out and export nothing to `64622`.

Therefore, we need to fallback to ask BIRD to *not* export the route to
AS 64600, 64610 and 64630 on `64620`. We could use a special community
to filter out the route but we keep it simple and just filter the
route directly.

    filter keep_local_dns {
       if net ~ [ 2001:db8:aaaa::/48 ] then reject;
       accept;
    }
    protocol bgp {
       description "BGP with peer NewYork";
       local as 64620;
       neighbor 2001:db8:ffff:4600:4620::1 as 64600;
       gateway direct;
       hold time 30;
       export filter keep_local_dns;
       import all;
    }

Voilà. Only `C4` will be able to query `L1`. If AS 64621 is missing,
it will query `G2` instead. One major point about anycast is to know
that redundancy is done at the AS level only. If the name server on
`L1` does not work correctly, requests will still be routed to
it. Therefore, with anycast, you still need to provide redundancy
inside each AS (or stop advertising the anycast network as soon as
there is a failure).

# Beyond DNS

Anycast can be used to serve HTTP requests too. This is less commonly
used because your connection may be rerouted to another node while it
is still running. This is not a problem with DNS because there is no
connection (you send a query, you receive an answer). There are at
least two CDN ([MaxCDN][maxcdn] and [CacheFly][cachefly]) which uses
anycast to ensure low roundtrip time and very high reliability.

Setting up an HTTP server with an anycast address is no different than
setting up a DNS server. However, you need to ensure maximum stability
of the routing path to avoid the connection to be dropped while
running. I suppose that this is done by hiring some high-level BGP
expert. You can also mix unicast and anycast:

 - anycast DNS answers the IP address of a nearby unicast HTTP server,
   or
 - anycast DNS answers the IP address of an anycast HTTP server that
   will issue a redirect to an unicast HTTP server when downloading or
   streaming large files.
