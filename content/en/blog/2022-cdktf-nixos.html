A few years ago, I downsized my personal infrastructure. Until 2018, there were
a dozen containers running on a single [Hetzner][] server.[^hetzner] I migrated
my emails to [Fastmail][] and my DNS zones to [Gandi][]. It left me with only my
blog to self-host. As of today, my low-scale infrastructure is composed of 4
virtual machines running [NixOS][] on *Hetzner Cloud* and [Vultr][], a handful
of DNS zones on *Gandi* and [Route 53][], and a couple of [Cloudfront][]
distributions. It is managed by [CDK for Terraform][] (CDKTF), while *NixOS*
deployments are handled by [NixOps][].

In this article, I provide a brief introduction to *Terraform*, *CDKTF*, and the
*Nix* ecosystem. I also explain how to use *Nix* to access these tools within
your shell, so you can quickly start using them.

[^hetzner]: It was an AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ with 2 GB of RAM and 2×400 GB disks
    with software RAID. I was paying something around 59 € per month for it.
    While it was a good deal in 2008, by 2018 it was no longer cost-effective.
    It was running on Debian Wheezy with [Linux-VServer][] for isolation, both
    of which were outdated in 2018.

[TOC]

# CDKTF: infrastructure as code

[Terraform][] is an "infrastructure-as-code" tool. You can define your
infrastructure by declaring resources with the [HCL language][]. This language
has some additional features like loops to declare several resources from a
list, built-in functions you can call in expressions, and string templates.
*Terraform* relies on a [large set of providers][] to manage resources.

## Managing servers

Here is a short example using the [Hetzner Cloud provider][] to spawn a virtual
machine:

```terraform
variable "hcloud_token" {
  sensitive = true
}
provider "hcloud" {
  token = var.hcloud_token
}

resource "hcloud_server" "web03" {
  name = "web03"
  server_type = "cpx11"
  image = "debian-11"
  datacenter = "nbg1-dc3"
}

resource "hcloud_rdns" "rdns4-web03" {
  server_id = hcloud_server.web03.id
  ip_address = hcloud_server.web03.ipv4_address
  dns_ptr = "web03.luffy.cx"
}

resource "hcloud_rdns" "rdns6-web03" {
  server_id = hcloud_server.web03.id
  ip_address = hcloud_server.web03.ipv6_address
  dns_ptr = "web03.luffy.cx"
}
```

*HCL* expressiveness is quite limited and I find a general-purpose language more
convenient to describe all the resources. This is where *CDK for Terraform*
comes in: you can manage your infrastructure using your preferred programming
language, including TypeScript, Go, and Python. Here is the previous example
using _CDKTF_ and TypeScript:

```typescript
import { App, TerraformStack, Fn } from "cdktf";
import { HcloudProvider } from "./.gen/providers/hcloud/provider";
import * as hcloud from "./.gen/providers/hcloud";

class MyStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);

    const hcloudToken = new TerraformVariable(this, "hcloudToken", {
      type: "string",
      sensitive: true,
    });
    const hcloudProvider = new HcloudProvider(this, "hcloud", {
      token: hcloudToken.value,
    });
    
    const web03 = new hcloud.server.Server(this, "web03", {
      name: "web03",
      serverType: "cpx11",
      image: "debian-11",
      datacenter: "nbg1-dc3",
      provider: hcloudProvider,
    });
    new hcloud.rdns.Rdns(this, "rdns4-web03", {
      serverId: Fn.tonumber(web03.id),
      ipAddress: web03.ipv4Address,
      dnsPtr: "web03.luffy.cx",
      provider: hcloudProvider,
    });
    new hcloud.rdns.Rdns(this, "rdns6-web03", {
      serverId: Fn.tonumber(web03.id),
      ipAddress: web03.ipv6Address,
      dnsPtr: "web03.luffy.cx",
      provider: hcloudProvider,
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyStack(app, "cdktf-take1");
app.synth();
```

Running `cdktf synth` generates a configuration file for *Terraform*, `terraform
plan` previews the changes, and `terraform apply` applies them. Now that you
have a general-purpose language, you can use functions.

## Managing DNS records

While using _CDKTF_ for 4 web servers may seem a tad overkill, this is quite
different when it comes to managing a few DNS zones. With [DNSControl][], which
is using JavaScript as a domain-specific language, I was able to define the
`bernat.ch` zone with this snippet of code:

```js
D("bernat.ch", REG_NONE, DnsProvider(DNS_BIND, 0), DnsProvider(DNS_GANDI),
  DefaultTTL('2h'),
  FastMailMX('bernat.ch', {subdomains: ['vincent']}),
  WebServers('@'),
  WebServers('vincent');
```

This generated 38 records. With _CDKTF_, I use:

```ts
new Route53Zone(this, "bernat.ch", providers.aws)
  .sign(dnsCMK)
  .registrar(providers.gandiVB)
  .www("@", servers)
  .www("vincent", servers)
  .www("media", servers)
  .fastmailMX(["vincent"]);
```

All the magic is in the code that I did not show you. You can check the
[dns.ts][] file in the [cdktf-take1][] repository to see how it works. Here is a
quick explanation:

- `Route53Zone()` creates a new zone hosted by *Route 53*,
- `sign()` signs the zone with the provided master key,
- `registrar()` registers the zone to the registrar of the domain and sets up DNSSEC,
- `www()` creates `A` and `AAAA` records for the provided name pointing to the web servers,
- `fastmailMX()` creates the `MX` records and other support records to direct emails to *Fastmail*.

Here is the content of the `fastmailMX()` function. It generates a few records
and returns the current zone for chaining:

```ts
fastmailMX(subdomains?: string[]) {
  (subdomains ?? [])
    .concat(["@", "*"])
    .forEach((subdomain) =>
      this.MX(subdomain, [
        "10 in1-smtp.messagingengine.com.",
        "20 in2-smtp.messagingengine.com.",
      ])
    );
  this.TXT("@", "v=spf1 include:spf.messagingengine.com ~all");
  ["mesmtp", "fm1", "fm2", "fm3"].forEach((dk) =>
    this.CNAME(`${dk}._domainkey`, `${dk}.${this.name}.dkim.fmhosted.com.`)
  );
  this.TXT("_dmarc", "v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none");
  return this;
}
```

I encourage you to browse the [repository][cdktf-take1] if you need more
information.

## About Pulumi

My first tentative around *Terraform* was to use [Pulumi][]. You can find this
attempt on [GitHub][pulumi-github]. This is quite similar to what I currently do
with _CDKTF_. The main difference is that I am using Python instead of TypeScript
because I was not familiar with TypeScript at the time.[^python]

[^python]: I also did not use Python because _Poetry_ support in _Nix_ was a bit
    [broken][] around the time I started hacking around _CDKTF_.

*Pulumi* predates _CDKTF_ and it uses a slightly different approach. _CDKTF_
generates a *Terraform* configuration (in JSON format instead of HCL), delegating
planning, state management, and deployment to *Terraform*. It is therefore bound
to the limitations of what can be expressed by *Terraform*, notably when you
need to transform data obtained from one resource to another.[^transform]
*Pulumi* needs specific providers for each resource. Many *Pulumi* providers are
thin wrappers encapsulating *Terraform* providers.

[^transform]: *Pulumi* can [apply arbitrary functions][] with the `apply()`
    method on an output. It makes it easy to transform data that are not known
    during the planning stage. *Terraform* has [functions][tf functions] to
    serve a similar purpose, but they are more limited.

While *Pulumi* provides a good user experience, I switched to CDKTF because
writing providers for *Pulumi* is a chore. CDKTF does not require such a step.
Outside the big players (AWS, Azure and Google Cloud), the existence, quality,
and freshness of the *Pulumi* providers are inconsistent. Most providers rely on
a *Terraform* provider and they may lag a few versions behind, miss a few
resources, or have a few bugs of their own.

When a provider does not exist, you can write one with the help of the
[pulumi-terraform-bridge][] library. The *Pulumi* project provides a
[boilerplate][] for this purpose. I had a bad experience with it when writing
providers for [Gandi][provider-gandi] and [Vultr][provider-vultr]: the
`Makefile` [automatically installs *Pulumi*][pulumi-pr51] using a `curl | sh`
pattern and [does not work with `/bin/sh`][pulumi-pr52]. There is a lack of
interest for community-based contributions[^maint] or even for [providers for
smaller players][].

[^maint]: The two mentioned pull requests are not merged yet. The second one is
    superseded by [PR #61][pulumi-pr61], submitted two months later, which
    enforces the use of `/bin/bash`. I also submitted [PR #56][pulumi-pr56],
    which was merged 4 months later and quickly [reverted][pulumi-pr66] without
    an explanation.

# NixOS & NixOps

[Nix][nix-lang] is a functional, purely-functional programming language.
[Nix][nix-tool] is also the name of the package manager that is built on top of
the _Nix_ language. It allows users to declaratively install packages.
[nixpkgs][] is a repository of packages. You can [install *Nix*][nix-install] on
top of a regular Linux distribution. If you want more details, a good resource
is the [official website][nix-web], and notably the [“learn” section][learn
section]. There is a steep learning curve, but the reward is tremendous.

## NixOS: declarative Linux distribution

[NixOS][] is a Linux distribution built on top of the _Nix_ package manager.
Here is a configuration snippet to add some packages:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs;
  [
    bat
    htop
    liboping
    mg
    mtr
    ncdu
    tmux
  ];
```

It is possible to alter an existing derivation[^derivation] to use a different version, enable a
specific feature, or apply a patch. Here is how I enable and configure *Nginx*
to disable the stream module, add the [Brotli compression module][], and add the
[IP address anonymizer module][]. Moreover, instead of using *OpenSSL 3*, I keep
using *OpenSSL 1.1*.[^openssl]

[^derivation]: You may consider packages and derivations to be synonyms in the
    *Nix* ecosystem.

```nix
services.nginx = {
  enable = true;

  package = (pkgs.nginxStable.override {
    withStream = false;
    modules = with pkgs.nginxModules; [
      brotli
      ipscrub
    ];
    openssl = pkgs.openssl_1_1;
  });
```

If you need to add some patches, it is also possible. Here are the patches I
added in 2019 to circumvent the [DoS vulnerabilities in *Nginx*][dos-nginx]
until they were fixed in *NixOS*:[^security]

```nix
services.nginx.package = pkgs.nginxStable.overrideAttrs (old: {
  patches = oldAttrs.patches ++ [
    # HTTP/2: reject zero length headers with PROTOCOL_ERROR.
    (pkgs.fetchpatch {
      url = https://github.com/nginx/nginx/commit/dbdd[…].patch;
      sha256 = "a48190[…]";
    })
    # HTTP/2: limited number of DATA frames.
    (pkgs.fetchpatch {
      url = https://github.com/nginx/nginx/commit/94c5[…].patch;
      sha256 = "af591a[…]";
    })
    #  HTTP/2: limited number of PRIORITY frames.
    (pkgs.fetchpatch {
      url = https://github.com/nginx/nginx/commit/39bb[…].patch;
      sha256 = "1ad8fe[…]";
    })
  ];
});
```

[^openssl]: *OpenSSL 3* has outstanding [performance regressions][].

[^security]: *NixOS* can be a bit slow to integrate patches since they need to
    rebuild parts of the binary cache before releasing the fixes. In this
    specific case, they were fast: the vulnerability and patches were released
    on August 13<sup>th</sup> 2019 and available in *NixOS* on August 15th. As a
    comparison, Debian only released the fixed version on August
    22<sup>nd</sup>, which is unusually late.

If you are interested, have a look at my relatively small configuration:
[`common.nix`][common.nix] contains the configuration to be applied to any host
(SSH, users, common software packages), [`web.nix`][web.nix] contains the
configuration for the web servers, [`isso.nix`][isso.nix] runs [Isso][] into a
*systemd* container.

## NixOps: NixOS deployment tool

On a single node, *NixOS* configuration is in the `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`
file. After modifying it, you have to run `nixos-rebuild switch`. *Nix* fetches
all possible dependencies from the binary cache and builds the remaining
packages. It creates a new entry in the boot loader menu and activates the new
configuration.

To manage several nodes, there exists several options, including [NixOps][],
[deploy-rs][], [Colmena][], and [morph][]. I do not know all of them, but from
my point of view, the differences are not that important. It is also possible to
build such a tool yourself as *Nix* provides the most important building blocks:
`nix build` and `nix copy`. *NixOps* is one of the first tools available but I
encourage you to explore the alternatives.

*NixOps* configuration is written in *Nix*. Here is a simplified configuration
to deploy `znc01.luffy.cx`, `web01.luffy.cx`, and `web02.luffy.cx`, with the
help of the `server` and `web` functions:

```nix
let
  server = hardware: name: imports: {
    deployment.targetHost = "${name}.luffy.cx";
    networking.hostName = name;
    networking.domain = "luffy.cx";
    imports = [ (./hardware/. + "/${hardware}.nix") ] ++ imports;
  };
  web = hardware: idx: imports:
    server hardware "web${lib.fixedWidthNumber 2 idx}" ([ ./web.nix ] ++ imports);
in {
  network.description = "Luffy infrastructure";
  network.enableRollback = true;
  defaults = import ./common.nix;
  znc01 = server "exoscale" [ ./znc.nix ];
  web01 = web "hetzner" 1 [ ./isso.nix ];
  web02 = web "hetzner" 2 [];
}
```

# Tying everything together with Nix

The *Nix* ecosystem is a unified solution to the various problems around
software and configuration management. A very interesting feature is the
[declarative and reproducible developer environments][]. This is similar to
Python virtual environments, except it is not language-specific.

## Brief introduction to Nix flakes

I am using [flakes][], a new *Nix* feature improving reproducibility by pinning
all dependencies and making the build hermetic. While the feature is marked as
experimental,[^experimental] it is widely used and you may see `flake.nix` and
`flake.lock` at the root of some repositories.

[^experimental]: Because *flakes* are experimental, many documentations do not
    use them and it is an additional aspect to learn.

As a short example, here is the `flake.nix` content shipped with [Snimpy][], an
interactive SNMP tool for Python relying on [libsmi][], a C library:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "nixpkgs";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };
  outputs = { self, ... }@inputs:
    inputs.flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = inputs.nixpkgs.legacyPackages."${system}";
      in
      {
        # nix build
        packages.default = pkgs.python3Packages.buildPythonPackage {
          name = "snimpy";
          src = self;
          preConfigure = ''echo "1.0.0-0-000000000000" > version.txt'';
          checkPhase = "pytest";
          checkInputs = with pkgs.python3Packages; [ pytest mock coverage ];
          propagatedBuildInputs = with pkgs.python3Packages; [ cffi pysnmp ipython ];
          buildInputs = [ pkgs.libsmi ];
        };
        # nix run + nix shell
        apps.default = { 
          type = "app";
          program = "${self.packages."${system}".default}/bin/snimpy";
        };
        # nix develop
        devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
          name = "snimpy-dev";
          buildInputs = [
            self.packages."${system}".default.inputDerivation
            pkgs.python3Packages.ipython
          ];
        };
      });
}
```

If you have *Nix* installed on your system:

- `nix run github:vincentbernat/snimpy` runs *Snimpy*,
- `nix shell github:vincentbernat/snimpy` provides a shell with *Snimpy* ready-to-use,
- `nix build github:vincentbernat/snimpy` builds the Python package, tests included, and
- `nix develop .` provides a shell to hack around *Snimpy*—when run from a fresh checkout.[^checkout]

[^checkout]: It is possible to replace `.` with `github:vincentbernat/snimpy`,
    like in the other commands, but having *Snimpy* dependencies without
    *Snimpy* source code is less interesting.

For more information about _Nix flakes_, have a look at [the tutorial from
Tweag][nix-flakes].

## Nix and CDKTF

At the root of the [repository I use for CDKTF][cdktf-take1], there is a
[`flake.nix`][cdktf-take1-flake.nix] file to set up a shell with *Terraform* and
*CDKTF* installed and with the appropriate environment variables to automate my
infrastructure.

*Terraform* is already packaged in *nixpkgs*. However, I need to apply a patch
on top of the *Gandi* provider. Not a problem with *Nix*!

```nix
terraform = pkgs.terraform.withPlugins (p: [
  p.aws
  p.hcloud
  p.vultr
  (p.gandi.overrideAttrs
    (old: {
      src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
        owner = "vincentbernat";
        repo = "terraform-provider-gandi";
        rev = "feature/livedns-key";
        hash = "sha256-V16BIjo5/rloQ1xTQrdd0snoq1OPuDh3fQNW7kiv/kQ=";
      };
    }))
]);
```

*CDKTF* is written in TypeScript. I have a
[`package.json`][cdktf-take1-package.json] file with all the dependencies
needed, including the ones to use TypeScript as the language to define
infrastructure:

```json
{
  "name": "cdktf-take1",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "main.js",
  "types": "main.ts",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^14.18.30",
    "cdktf": "^0.13.3",
    "cdktf-cli": "^0.13.3",
    "constructs": "^10.1.151",
    "eslint": "^8.27.0",
    "prettier": "^2.7.1",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.1",
    "typescript": "^3.9.10",
    "typescript-language-server": "^2.1.0"
  }
}
```

I use [Yarn][] to get a [`yarn.lock`][cdktf-take1-yarn.lock] file that can be
used directly to declare a derivation containing all the dependencies:

```nix
nodeEnv = pkgs.mkYarnModules {
  pname = "cdktf-take1-js-modules";
  version = "1.0.0";
  packageJSON = ./package.json;
  yarnLock = ./yarn.lock;
};
```

The next step is to generate the *CDKTF* providers from the *Terraform* providers
and turn them into a derivation:

```nix
cdktfProviders = pkgs.stdenvNoCC.mkDerivation {
  name = "cdktf-providers";
  nativeBuildInputs = [
    pkgs.nodejs
    terraform
  ];
  src = nix-filter {
    root = ./.;
    include = [ ./cdktf.json ./tsconfig.json ];
  };
  buildPhase = ''
    export HOME=$(mktemp -d)
    export CHECKPOINT_DISABLE=1
    export DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1
    export PATH=${nodeEnv}/node_modules/.bin:$PATH
    ln -nsf ${nodeEnv}/node_modules node_modules

    # Build all providers we have in terraform
    for provider in $(cd ${terraform}/libexec/terraform-providers; echo */*/*/*); do
      version=''${provider##*/}
      provider=''${provider%/*}
      echo "Build $provider@$version"
      cdktf provider add --force-local $provider@$version | cat
    done
    echo "Compile TS → JS"
    tsc
  '';
  installPhase = ''
    mv .gen $out
    ln -nsf ${nodeEnv}/node_modules $out/node_modules
  '';
};
```

Finally, we can define the development environment:

```nix
devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
  name = "cdktf-take1";
  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.nodejs
    pkgs.yarn
    terraform
  ];
  shellHook = ''
    # No telemetry
    export CHECKPOINT_DISABLE=1
    # No autoinstall of plugins
    export CDKTF_DISABLE_PLUGIN_CACHE_ENV=1
    # Do not check version
    export DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1
    # Access to node modules
    export PATH=$PWD/node_modules/.bin:$PATH
    ln -nsf ${nodeEnv}/node_modules node_modules
    ln -nsf ${cdktfProviders} .gen

    # Credentials
    for p in \
      njf.nznmba.pbz/Nqzvavfgengbe \
      urgmare.pbz/ivaprag@oreang.pu \
      ihyge.pbz/ihyge@ivaprag.oreang.pu; do
        eval $(pass show $(echo $p | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m') | grep '^export')
    done
    eval $(pass show personal/cdktf/secrets | grep '^export')
    export TF_VAR_hcloudToken="$HCLOUD_TOKEN"
    export TF_VAR_vultrApiKey="$VULTR_API_KEY"
    unset VULTR_API_KEY HCLOUD_TOKEN
  '';
};
```

The derivations listed in `buildInputs` are available in the provided shell.
The content of `shellHook` is sourced when starting the shell. It sets up some
symbolic links to make the JavaScript environment built at an earlier step
available, as well as the generated *CDKTF* providers. It also exports all the
credentials.[^obfuscated]

[^obfuscated]: I am using [pass][] as a password manager. The password names are
    only obfuscated to avoid spam.

I am also using [direnv][] with an [`.envrc`][cdktf-take1-envrc] to
automatically load the development environment. This also enables the
environment to be available from inside *Emacs*, notably when using [lsp-mode][]
to get TypeScript completions. Without *direnv*, `nix develop .` can activate
the environment.

I use the following commands to deploy the infrastructure:[^cdktf-cli]

```console
$ cdktf synth
$ cd cdktf.out/stacks/cdktf-take1
$ terraform plan --out plan
$ terraform apply plan
$ terraform output -json > ~-automation/nixops-take1/cdktf.json
```

[^cdktf-cli]: The `cdktf` command can wrap the `terraform` commands, but I
    prefer to use them directly as they are more flexible.

The last command generates a JSON file containing various data to complete the
deployment with *NixOps*.

## NixOps

The [JSON file][cdktf-take1-cdktf.json] exported by *Terraform* contains the list of servers with various
attributes:

```json
{
  "hardware": "hetzner",
  "ipv4Address": "5.161.44.145",
  "ipv6Address": "2a01:4ff:f0:b91::1",
  "name": "web05.luffy.cx",
  "tags": [
    "web",
    "continent:NA",
    "continent:SA"
  ]
}
```

In [`network.nix`][nixops-take1-network.nix], this list is imported and
transformed into an attribute set describing the servers. A simplified version
looks like this:

```nix
let
  lib = inputs.nixpkgs.lib;
  shortName = name: builtins.elemAt (lib.splitString "." name) 0;
  domainName = name: lib.concatStringsSep "." (builtins.tail (lib.splitString "." name));
  server = hardware: name: imports: {
    networking = {
      hostName = shortName name;
      domain = domainName name;
    };
    deployment.targetHost = name;
    imports = [ (./hardware/. + "/${hardware}.nix") ] ++ imports;
  };
  cdktf-servers-json = (lib.importJSON ./cdktf.json).servers.value;
  cdktf-servers = map
    (s:
      let
        tags-maybe-import = map (t: ./. + "/${t}.nix") s.tags;
        tags-import = builtins.filter (t: builtins.pathExists t) tags-maybe-import;
      in
      {
        name = shortName s.name;
        value = server s.hardware s.name tags-import;
      })
    cdktf-servers-json;
in
{
  // […]
} // builtins.listToAttrs cdktf-servers
```

For `web05`, this expands to:

```nix
web05 = {
  networking = {
    hostName = "web05";
    domainName = "luffy.cx";
  };
  deployment.targetHost = "web05.luffy.cx";
  imports = [ ./hardware/hetzner.nix ./web.nix ];
};
```

As for *CDKTF*, at the root of the [repository I use for NixOps][nixops-take1],
there is a [`flake.nix`][nixops-take1-flake.nix] file to set up a shell with
*NixOps* configured. Because *NixOps* do not support rollouts, I usually use the
following commands to deploy on a single server:[^disable]

```console
$ nix flake update
$ nixops deploy --include=web04
$ ./tests web04.luffy.cx
```

[^disable]: If the change is risky, I [disable the server][] with CDKTF. This
    removes it from the web service DNS records.

If the tests are OK, I deploy the remaining nodes gradually with the following
command:

```console
$ (set -e; for h in web{03..06}; do nixops deploy --include=$h; done)
```

`nixops deploy` rolls out all servers in parallel and therefore could cause a
short outage where all *Nginx* are down at the same time.

This post has been a work-in-progress for the past three years, with the content
being updated and refined as I experimented with different solutions. There is
still much to explore[^todo] but I feel there is enough content to publish now.
🎄

[^todo]: I would like to replace *NixOps* with an alternative handling
    progressive rollouts and checks. I am also considering switching to
    [Nomad][] or *Kubernetes* to deploy workloads.
