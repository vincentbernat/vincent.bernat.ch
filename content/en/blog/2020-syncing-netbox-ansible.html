The [`netbox.netbox` collection][collection] from [Ansible Galaxy][]
provides several modules to update [NetBox][] objects:

    ::yaml
    - name: create a device in NetBox
      netbox_device:
        netbox_url: http://netbox.local
        netbox_token: s3cret
        data:
          name: to3-p14.sfo1.example.com
          device_type: QFX5110-48S
          device_role: Compute Switch
          site: SFO1

However, if *NetBox* is **not your source of truth**, you may want to
ensure it stays in sync with your configuration management
database[^cmdb] by removing outdated devices or IP addresses. While it
should be possible to glue together a playbook with a query, a loop,
and some filtering to delete unwanted elements, it feels clunky,
inefficient, and abuse of YAML as a programming language. A specific
Ansible module solves this issue and is likely more flexible.

[^cmdb]: In my opinion, a good option for a *source of truth* is to
    use YAML files in a *Git* repository. You get versioning for free
    and people can get started with a text editor.

!!! "Notice" I recommend that you read "[Writing a custom Ansible
module][]" as an introduction, as well as "[Syncing MySQL tables][]"
for a first simpler example.

# Code

The [module][] has the following signature and it syncs *NetBox* with
the content of the provided YAML file:

    ::yaml
    netbox_sync:
      source: netbox.yaml
      api: https://netbox.example.com
      token: s3cret

The synchronized objects are:

 - sites
 - manufacturers
 - device types
 - device roles
 - devices
 - IP addresses

In our environment, the YAML file is generated from our configuration
management database and contains a set of devices and a list of IP
addresses:

    ::yaml
    devices:
      ad2-p6.sfo1.example.com:
         datacenter: sfo1
         manufacturer: Cisco
         model: Catalyst 2960G-48TC-L
         role: net_tor_oob_switch
      to1-p6.sfo1.example.com:
         datacenter: sfo1
         manufacturer: Juniper
         model: QFX5110-48S
         role: net_tor_gpu_switch
    # […]
    ips:
      - device: ad2-p6.example.com
        ip: 172.31.115.18/21
        interface: oob
      - device: to1-p6.example.com
        ip: 172.31.115.33/21
        interface: oob
      - device: to1-p6.example.com
        ip: 172.31.254.33/32
        interface: lo0.0
    # […]

The network team is not the sole tenant in *NetBox*. While adding new
objects or modifying existing ones should be relatively safe, deleting
unwanted objects can be risky. The module only deletes objects it did
create or modify. To identify them, it marks them with a specific tag,
`cmdb`. Most objects in *NetBox* accept tags.

## Module definition

Starting from the skeleton described in the [previous article][Writing
a custom Ansible module], we define the module:

    ::python
    module_args = dict(
        source=dict(type='path', required=True),
        api=dict(type='str', required=True),
        token=dict(type='str', required=True, no_log=True),
        max_workers=dict(type='int', required=False, default=10)
    )

    result = dict(
        changed=False
    )

    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=module_args,
        supports_check_mode=True
    )

It contains additional optional arguments defining the number of
workers to talk to *NetBox* and query the existing objects in parallel
to speed up the execution.

## Abstracting synchronization

We need to synchronize different object types, but once we have a list
of objects we want in *NetBox*, the grunt work is always the same:

- check if the objects already exist,
- retrieve them and put them in a form suitable for comparison,
- retrieve the extra objects we don't want anymore,
- compare the two sets, and
- add missing objects, update existing ones, delete extra ones.

We code these behaviors into a `Synchronizer` abstract class. For each
kind of object, a concrete class is built with the appropriate [class
attributes][] to tune its behavior and a `wanted()` method to provide
the objects we want.

I am not explaining the abstract class code here. Have a look at the
[source][module] if you want.

### Synchronizing tags and tenants

As a starter, here is how we define the class synchronizing the tags:

    ::python
    class SyncTags(Synchronizer):
        app = "extras"
        table = "tags"
        key = "name"
    
        def wanted(self):
            return {"cmdb": dict(
                slug="cmdb",
                color="8bc34a",
                description="synced by network CMDB")}

The `app` and `table` attributes define the *NetBox* objects we want
to manipulate. The `key` attribute is used to determine how to lookup
for existing objects. In this example, we want to lookup tags using
their names.

The `wanted()` method is expected to return a dictionary mapping
object keys to the list of wanted attributes. Here, the keys are tag
names and we create only one tag, `cmdb`, with the provided slug,
color, and description. This is the tag we will use to mark the objects
we create or modify.

If the tag does not exist, it is created. If it exists, the provided
attributes are updated. Other attributes are left untouched.

We also want to create a specific tenant for objects accepting such an
attribute (devices and IP addresses):

    ::python
    class SyncTenants(Synchronizer):
        app = "tenancy"
        table = "tenants"
        key = "name"
    
        def wanted(self):
            return {"Network": dict(slug="network",
                                    description="Network team")}

### Synchronizing sites

We also need to synchronize the list of sites. This time, the
`wanted()` method uses the information provided in the YAML file: it
walks the devices and builds a set of datacenter names.

    ::python
    class SyncSites(Synchronizer):
    
        app = "dcim"
        table = "sites"
        key = "name"
        only_on_create = ("status", "slug")
    
        def wanted(self):
            result = set(details["datacenter"]
                         for details in self.source['devices'].values()
                         if "datacenter" in details)
            return {k: dict(slug=k,
                            status="planned")
                    for k in result}

Thanks to the use of the `only_on_create` attribute, the specified
attributes are not updated if they are different. The goal of this
synchronizer is mostly to collect the references to the different
sites for other objects.

    ::pycon
    >>> pprint(SyncSites(**sync_args).wanted())
    {'sfo1': {'slug': 'sfo1', 'status': 'planned'},
     'chi1': {'slug': 'chi1', 'status': 'planned'},
     'nyc1': {'slug': 'nyc1', 'status': 'planned'}}

### Synchronizing manufacturers, device types, and device roles

The synchronization of manufacturers is pretty similar, except we do
not use the `only_on_create` attribute:

    ::python
    class SyncManufacturers(Synchronizer):
    
        app = "dcim"
        table = "manufacturers"
        key = "name"
    
        def wanted(self):
            result = set(details["manufacturer"]
                         for details in self.source['devices'].values()
                         if "manufacturer" in details)
            return {k: {"slug": slugify(k)}
                    for k in result}

Regarding the device types, we use the `foreign` attribute linking
a *NetBox* attribute to the synchronizer handling it.

    ::python
    class SyncDeviceTypes(Synchronizer):
    
        app = "dcim"
        table = "device_types"
        key = "model"
        foreign = {"manufacturer": SyncManufacturers}
    
        def wanted(self):
            result = set((details["manufacturer"], details["model"])
                         for details in self.source['devices'].values()
                         if "model" in details)
            return {k[1]: dict(manufacturer=k[0],
                               slug=slugify(k[1]))
                    for k in result}

The `wanted()` method refers to the manufacturer using its `key`
attribute. In this case, this is the manufacturer name.

    ::pycon
    >>> pprint(SyncManufacturers(**sync_args).wanted())
    {'Cisco': {'slug': 'cisco'},
     'Dell': {'slug': 'dell'},
     'Juniper': {'slug': 'juniper'}}
    >>> pprint(SyncDeviceTypes(**sync_args).wanted())
    {'ASR 9001': {'manufacturer': 'Cisco', 'slug': 'asr-9001'},
     'Catalyst 2960G-48TC-L': {'manufacturer': 'Cisco',
                               'slug': 'catalyst-2960g-48tc-l'},
     'MX10003': {'manufacturer': 'Juniper', 'slug': 'mx10003'},
     'QFX10002-36Q': {'manufacturer': 'Juniper', 'slug': 'qfx10002-36q'},
     'QFX10002-72Q': {'manufacturer': 'Juniper', 'slug': 'qfx10002-72q'},
     'QFX5110-32Q': {'manufacturer': 'Juniper', 'slug': 'qfx5110-32q'},
     'QFX5110-48S': {'manufacturer': 'Juniper', 'slug': 'qfx5110-48s'},
     'QFX5200-32C': {'manufacturer': 'Juniper', 'slug': 'qfx5200-32c'},
     'S4048-ON': {'manufacturer': 'Dell', 'slug': 's4048-on'},
     'S6010-ON': {'manufacturer': 'Dell', 'slug': 's6010-on'}}

The device roles are defined like this:

    ::python
    class SyncDeviceRoles(Synchronizer):
    
        app = "dcim"
        table = "device_roles"
        key = "name"
    
        def wanted(self):
            result = set(details["role"]
                         for details in self.source['devices'].values()
                         if "role" in details)
            return {k: dict(slug=slugify(k),
                            color="8bc34a")
                    for k in result}

### Synchronizing devices

A device is mostly a name with references to a role, a model, a
datacenter and a tenant. These references are declared as foreign keys
using the synchronizers defined previously.

    ::python
    class SyncDevices(Synchronizer):
        app = "dcim"
        table = "devices"
        key = "name"
        foreign = {"device_role": SyncDeviceRoles,
                   "device_type": SyncDeviceTypes,
                   "site": SyncSites,
                   "tenant": SyncTenants}
        remove_unused = 10
    
        def wanted(self):
            return {name: dict(device_role=details["role"],
                               device_type=details["model"],
                               site=details["datacenter"],
                               tenant="Network")
                    for name, details in self.source['devices'].items()
                    if {"datacenter", "model", "role"} <= set(details.keys())}

The `remove_unused` attribute is a safety implemented to fail if we
have to delete more than 10 devices: this may be the indication there
is a bug somewhere, unless one of your datacenter suddenly caught
fire.

    ::pycon
    >>> pprint(SyncDevices(**sync_args).wanted())
    {'ad2-p6.sfo1.example.com': {'device_role': 'net_tor_oob_switch',
                                 'device_type': 'Catalyst 2960G-48TC-L',
                                 'site': 'sfo1',
                                 'tenant': 'Network'},
     'to1-p6.sfo1.example.com': {'device_role': 'net_tor_gpu_switch',
                                 'device_type': 'QFX5110-48S',
                                 'site': 'sfo1',
                                 'tenant': 'Network'},
    […]

### Synchronizing IP addresses

The last step is to synchronize IP addresses. We do not attach them to
a device.[^devices] Instead, we specify the device names in the
description of the IP address:

    ::python
    class SyncIPs(Synchronizer):
        app = "ipam"
        table = "ip-addresses"
        key = "address"
        foreign = {"tenant": SyncTenants}
        remove_unused = 1000
    
        def wanted(self):
            wanted = {}
            for details in self.source['ips']:
                if details['ip'] in wanted:
                    wanted[details['ip']]['description'] = \
                        f"{details['device']} (and others)"
                else:
                    wanted[details['ip']] = dict(
                        tenant="Network",
                        status="active",
                        dns_name="",        # information is present in DNS
                        description=f"{details['device']}: {details['interface']}",
                        role=None,
                        vrf=None)
            return wanted

[^devices]: This limitation is mostly due to laziness: we do not care
    about this information. Our main motivation for putting IP
    addresses in *NetBox* is to keep track of the used IP addresses.
    However, if an IP address is already attached to an interface, we
    leave this association untouched.

There is a slight difficulty: *NetBox* allows duplicate IP addresses,
so a simple lookup is not enough. In case of multiple matches, we
choose the best by preferring those tagged with `cmdb`, then those
already attached to an interface:

    ::python
    def get(self, key):
        """Grab IP address from NetBox."""
        # There may be duplicate. We need to grab the "best."
        results = super(Synchronizer, self).get(key)
        if len(results) == 0:
            return None
        if len(results) == 1:
            return results[0]
        scores = [0]*len(results)
        for idx, result in enumerate(results):
            if "cmdb" in result.tags:
                scores[idx] += 10
            if result.interface is not None:
                scores[idx] += 5
        return sorted(zip(scores, results),
                      reverse=True, key=lambda k: k[0])[0][1]


## Getting the current and wanted states

Each synchronizer is initialized with a reference to the Ansible
module, a reference to a [pynetbox][]'s API object, the data contained
in the provided YAML file and two empty dictionaries for the current
and expected states:

    ::python
    source = yaml.safe_load(open(module.params['source']))
    netbox = pynetbox.api(module.params['api'],
                          token=module.params['token'])

    sync_args = dict(
        module=module,
        netbox=netbox,
        source=source,
        before={},
        after={}
    )
    synchronizers = [synchronizer(**sync_args) for synchronizer in [
        SyncTags,
        SyncTenants,
        SyncSites,
        SyncManufacturers,
        SyncDeviceTypes,
        SyncDeviceRoles,
        SyncDevices,
        SyncIPs
    ]]

Each synchronizer has a `prepare()` method whose goal is to compute
the current and wanted states. It returns `True` in case of a
difference:

    ::python
    # Check what needs to be synchronized
    try:
        for synchronizer in synchronizers:
            result['changed'] |= synchronizer.prepare()
    except AnsibleError as e:
        result['msg'] = e.message
        module.fail_json(**result)

## Applying changes

Back to the skeleton described in the [previous article][Writing a
custom Ansible module], the last step is to apply the changes if there
is a difference between these states. Each synchronizer registers the
current and wanted states in `sync_args["before"][table]` and
`sync_args["after"][table]` where `table` is the name of the table for
a given *NetBox* object type. The `diff` object is a bit elaborate as
it is built table by table. This enables *Ansible* to display the name
of each table before the diff representation:

    ::python
    # Compute the diff
    if module._diff and result['changed']:
        result['diff'] = [
            dict(
                before_header=table,
                after_header=table,
                before=yaml.safe_dump(sync_args["before"][table]),
                after=yaml.safe_dump(sync_args["after"][table]))
            for table in sync_args["after"]
            if sync_args["before"][table] != sync_args["after"][table]
        ]

    # Stop here if check mode is enabled or if no change
    if module.check_mode or not result['changed']:
        module.exit_json(**result)

Each synchronizer also exposes a `synchronize()` method to apply
changes and a `cleanup()` method to delete unwanted objects. Order is
important due to the relation between the objects.

    ::python
    # Synchronize
    for synchronizer in synchronizers:
        synchronizer.synchronize()
    for synchronizer in synchronizers[::-1]:
        synchronizer.cleanup()
    module.exit_json(**result)

The complete code is available on [GitHub][module]. Compared to using
[`netbox.netbox` collection][collection], the logic is written in
Python instead of trying to glue Ansible tasks together. I believe
this is both more flexible and easier to read, notably when trying to
delete outdated objects. While I did not test it, it should also be
faster.

!!! "Update (2020-12)" "[Using NetBox for Ansible Source of Truth][]"
shows how to update NetBox using the `netbox.netbox` collection. You
may compare the code with the solution I propose. The main difference
between the two is the cleaning of outdated objects in NetBox, which
is absent from the former solution.

An alternative would have been to reuse code from the `netbox.netbox`
collection, as it contains similar primitives. Unfortunately, I didn't
think of it until now. 😶
