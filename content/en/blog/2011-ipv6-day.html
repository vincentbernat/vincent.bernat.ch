On June 8, 2011, will be [World IPv6 Day][ipv6day]. Major
web companies like Google, Yahoo! and Facebook will serve their
content through IPv6. While some of them already provide IPv6 content,
you either need to use a special URL or get your connection from some
selected providers, known to provide working IPv6 connection (the
selection is done through DNS).

# What's World IPv6 Day about?

World IPv6 Day is mostly about major content providers and network
operators. End users are not expected to take any special actions. The
content will be provided for one day on IPv6 and IPv4 without any
special trick to circumvent broken IPv6 setup. If you have an IPv4
only connectivity, all will continue to work (this day is not about
switching Internet to IPv6 only). If you have a working
IPv6 connectivity of any kind, you will use it to access
content. However, if you have a broken IPv6 connectivity, you will
find yourself isolated during one day until you solve the problem. You
can [check your connectivity][ipv6test] and determine if you will run
into trouble on World IPv6 Day.

The main point of this day is to check if IPv6 native content can be
provided to anybody without leaving out a large part of the users (the
ones with a broken connectivity) which is reason why we don't already
have IPv6 native content everywhere. [Google explains it][ipv6faq] this way:

> We continuously conduct detailed measurements on the quality of IPv6
> connectivity, and our latest results show that making Google services
> generally available over IPv6 at this time would lead to connection
> problems and increased latency for a small number of users. User
> experience is very important to us, and we do not want to impact users
> on networks that do not yet fully support IPv6. We will continue to
> re-evaluate the situation as the IPv6 Internet evolves.

While content provider are invited to provide IPv6 content, network
operator are expected to troubleshoot their customers' problem (and
they cannot withdraw themselves from this operation since the main
change is done by content providers). If they can enable IPv6
connectivity, that would be great too but this is not mandatory.

**UPDATED:** It's a shame but Microsoft's participation to World IPv6
day is a ["fix" to prefer IPv4 over IPv6][msfix]. Moreover, this fix
will be reverted a few days later. Let's hope that network operators
don't follow the lead by not setting up DNS hijacking to remove `AAAA`
record.

# What can I do?

Even if you are neither a network operator nor a major player in web
content publishing, it is expected that World IPv6 Day will also be
the playground for most IPv6 related things.

## As a user

Check if your ISP provides native IPv6 connectivity. This can be an
opt-in option. For example, in France, [Free][free] allows its users to
enable native IPv6 connectivity if they choose the appropriate
option. That's easy to do and you get IPv6 in a matter of minutes.

If your ISP does not provide native IPv6 connectivity, you can try to
bug them about this. This is unlikely to work. You can also get IPv6
through a tunnel broker like [SixXS][sixxs] (create an account and
`apt-get install aiccu`) or [Hurricane Electric][he6]. Wikipedia has a
[list of IPv6 tunnel brokers][brokers]. Don't rely on any other
transition mechanism, they are unreliable.

## As a service provider

If you host yourself some services, like your web page or your own
mail server, you can enable IPv6 connectivity for those as well. Get
an IPv6 connectivity for your services, either native or through a
[tunnel broker][brokers].

Then, enable IPv6 on each service you provide. Check that they are
listening on IPv6 with `ss -6l`. All the tips below are meant for very
simple setup. Ensure that `net.ipv6.bindv6only` is set to 0. Here is
what I have done:

 - Enable **SSH** access through IPv6. With the default configuration
   of OpenSSH, this is already done. Check your `ListenAddress`
   directive if you have one.
 - Serve **Web** content through IPv6. I am using [Nginx][nginx] as
   a web server and you can mix IPv4 and IPv6 in the same virtual
   host. Setting up IPv6 is easy. Ensure that IPv6 support is compiled
   in (`nginx -V`) use `listen [::]:80` instead of `listen 80`. Apache
   is equally easy to configure and should even work out of the box
   since the `Listen 80` directive will listen to both IPv4 and IPv6
   by default. [lighttpd][lighttpd] also supports IPv6. An easy way to
   get started is to use `server.use-ipv6 = "enable"`.
 - Enable IPv6 in **Postfix**, **Dovecot**, **BIND**. For all of
   those, this works out of the box. Nowadays, most daemons will work
   fine with IPv6 without any special configuration since they will
   listen to `::` by default which means "any IPv4 or IPv6 address" as
   long as `net.ipv6.bindv6only` is set to 0. Unfortunately, there is
   still some daemons that do not support IPv6.
 - Add appropriate `AAAA` record to your **DNS** because providing
   IPv6 services is of little use if your users (including you) cannot
   access them without typing the appropriate IP address. You may also
   want to provide a `NS` record reachable through IPv6.
 - Update your **monitoring** to use IPv6 as well. If you advertise
   IPv6 service and only IPv4 is working, most IPv6 client will be
   unable to access them.
 - Adapt your **firewall**. In Linux, Netfilter handles IPv4 and IPv6
   separately. You need to ensure you setup a correct firewall for
   IPv6 as you have done with IPv4.

Here is a minimal firewall that you can adapt:

    ::sh
    ip6tables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    ip6tables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
    for chain in INPUT OUTPUT; do
      ip6tables -A $chain -m rt --rt-type 0 -j DROP
      ip6tables -A $chain -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type neighbor-solicitation \
         -m hl --hl-eq 255 -j ACCEPT
      ip6tables -A $chain -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type neighbor-advertisement \
         -m hl --hl-eq 255 -j ACCEPT
      ip6tables -A $chain -m state --state NEW \
         -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
    done
    ip6tables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    ip6tables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

    # Put your rules here!

    ip6tables -N REJECT_ALL
    ip6tables -A REJECT_ALL -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
    ip6tables -A REJECT_ALL -p udp -j REJECT --reject-with icmp6-adm-prohibited
    ip6tables -A REJECT_ALL -j DROP
    for chain in INPUT OUTPUT FORWARD; do
        ip6tables -A $chain -j LOG --log-prefix "$chain-reject: "
        ip6tables -A $chain -j REJECT_ALL
    done

# Debian status

There is still a
[long way for full IPv6 support of all applications][bugipv6] in
Debian but it is a release goal since Etch. This is not an easy task
since adding IPv6 support on some software can be really
difficult. [DSA][dsa] also enabled IPv6 support on many servers used
by the Debian project including the main web server, the main mirror,
the security mirror and the name servers. You should be able to use
Debian with an IPv6 only access.
