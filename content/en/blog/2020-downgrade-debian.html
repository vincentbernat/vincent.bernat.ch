Unlike [NixOS][], Debian doesn't have a builtin mechanism to rollback
an installation to a specific point in time. However, thanks to
[snapshot.debian.org][], a wayback machine for Debian packages, it is
possible to downgrade all packages to the versions from a chosen
date.

Let's suppose we want to go back to January, 20<sup>th</sup> 2020. In
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/snapshot.list`, we add a date-specific
snapshot as a source:

    ::sources.list
    deb [check-valid-until=no] https://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20200120T111800Z/ unstable main contrib non-free

In `/etc/apt/preferences.d/snapshot.pref`, we set the priority of all
packages from this source to 1001. This is above the default priority
of 500 and over 1000 to allow downgrade. See [`apt_preferences(5)`
manual page][man] for more details.

    ::control
    Package: *
    Pin: origin snapshot.debian.org
    Pin-Priority: 1001

After running `apt update`, we can check the result with `apt policy`:

    ::console
    $ apt policy
    Package files:
     100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
         release a=now
    1001 https://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20200120T111800Z unstable/non-free amd64 Packages
         release o=Debian,a=unstable,n=sid,l=Debian,c=non-free,b=amd64
         origin snapshot.debian.org
    1001 https://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20200120T111800Z unstable/contrib amd64 Packages
         release o=Debian,a=unstable,n=sid,l=Debian,c=contrib,b=amd64
         origin snapshot.debian.org
    1001 https://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20200120T111800Z unstable/main amd64 Packages
         release o=Debian,a=unstable,n=sid,l=Debian,c=main,b=amd64
         origin snapshot.debian.org
    […]

When requesting an *upgrade*, we will effectively be proposed to
downgrade everything to the versions in the snapshot:

    ::console hl_lines="8"
    $ sudo apt upgrade
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree
    Reading state information... Done
    Calculating upgrade... Done
    The following NEW packages will be installed:
      libdns-export1104 libgspell-1-1 libiptc0 libisc-export1100
    The following packages will be DOWNGRADED:
      bash-completion bear binutils binutils-common binutils-dev binutils-doc
      binutils-x86-64-linux-gnu bison blackbird-gtk-theme blender blender-data
      clang-6.0 clang-7 clang-8 clang-tools-8 cpp-9 cppcheck cpuid cups
      […]
    0 upgraded, 4 newly installed, 451 downgraded, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
    Need to get 1,053 MB/1,060 MB of archives.
    After this operation, 9,282 kB disk space will be freed.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
