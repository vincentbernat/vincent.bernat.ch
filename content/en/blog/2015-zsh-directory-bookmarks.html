There [are][1] [numerous][2] [projects][3] to implement directory
bookmarks in your favorite shell. An inherent limitation of these
implementations is they being only an "enhanced" `cd` command: you
cannot use a bookmark in an arbitrary command.

!!! "Update (2015-02)" My initial implementation with *Zsh* was using
*dynamic named directories*. I have been pointed [on][4] [Twitter][5]
that there is a simpler way to implement bookmarks. The article has
been updated to reflect that. As a side note, it is also possible to
just use shell variables.[^variables]

[^variables]: For example:

        ::console
        $ lldpd=/home/bernat/code/deezer/lldpd
        $ echo $lldpd/README.md
        /home/bernat/code/deezer/lldpd/README.md
        $ head -n1 $lldpd/README.md
        lldpd: implementation of IEEE 802.1ab (LLDP)

    The drawback is that you don't have a separate namespace for your
    bookmarks. You can still use a special prefix for that. Also, no
    prompt expansion.

[Zsh][] comes with a not well-known feature called **static named
directories**. They are declared with the `hash` builtin and can be
referred by prepending `~` to them:

    ::console
    $ hash -d -- -lldpd=/home/bernat/code/deezer/lldpd
    $ echo ~-lldpd/README.md
    /home/bernat/code/deezer/lldpd/README.md
    $ head -n1 ~-lldpd/README.md
    lldpd: implementation of IEEE 802.1ab (LLDP)

Because `~-lldpd` is substituted during file name expansion, it is
possible to use it in any command like a regular directory, like shown
above. The `-` prefix is only here to avoid collision with home
directories.

Bookmarks are kept into a dedicated directory, `$MARKPATH`. Each
bookmark is a symbolic link to the target directory: for example,
`~-lldpd` should be expanded to `$MARKPATH/lldpd` which points to the
appropriate directory. Assuming that you have populated `$MARKPATH`
with some links, here is how bookmarks are registered:

    ::sh
    for link ($MARKPATH/*(N@)) {
        hash -d -- -${link:t}=${link:A}
    }

You also automatically get completion and prompt expansion:

    ::console
    $ pwd
    /home/bernat/code/deezer/lldpd/src/lib
    $ echo ${(%):-%~}
    ~-lldpd/src/lib

The last step is to manage bookmarks without adding or removing
symbolic links manually. The following `bookmark()` function will display the
existing bookmarks when called without arguments, will remove a
bookmark when called with `-d` or add the current directory as a
bookmark otherwise.

    ::sh
    bookmark() {
        if (( $# == 0 )); then
            # When no arguments are provided, just display existing
            # bookmarks
            for link in $MARKPATH/*(N@); do
                local markname="$fg[green]${link:t}$reset_color"
                local markpath="$fg[blue]${link:A}$reset_color"
                printf "%-30s -> %s\n" $markname $markpath
            done
        else
            # Otherwise, we may want to add a bookmark or delete an
            # existing one.
            local -a delete
            zparseopts -D d=delete
            if (( $+delete[1] )); then
                # With `-d`, we delete an existing bookmark
                command rm $MARKPATH/$1
            else
                # Otherwise, add a bookmark to the current
                # directory. The first argument is the bookmark
                # name. `.` is special and means the bookmark should
                # be named after the current directory.
                local name=$1
                [ $name == "." ] && name=${PWD:t}
                ln -s $PWD $MARKPATH/$name
            fi
        fi
    }

# Dynamic named directories

Another (more complex) way to achieve the same thing is using
**dynamic named directories**. I was initially using this solution but
it is far more complex. This section is only here for historical
reason. You can find the complete implementation in my
[Git repository][].

During file name expansion, a `~` followed by a string in square
brackets is provided to the `zsh_directory_name()` function which will
eventually reply with a directory name. This feature can be used to
implement directory bookmarks:

    ::console
    $ cd ~[@lldpd]
    $ pwd
    /home/bernat/code/deezer/lldpd
    $ echo ~[@lldpd]/README.md
    /home/bernat/code/deezer/lldpd/README.md
    $ head -n1 ~[@lldpd]/README.md
    lldpd: implementation of IEEE 802.1ab (LLDP)

Like for *static named directories*, because `~[@lldpd]` is
substituted during file name expansion, it is possible to use it in
any command like a regular directory. 

## Basic implementation

Bookmarks are still kept into a dedicated directory, `$MARKPATH` and
are still symbolic links. Here is how the core feature is implemented:

    ::sh
    _bookmark_directory_name() {
        emulate -L zsh # ❶
        setopt extendedglob
        case $1 in
            n)
                [​[ $2 != (​#b)"@"(?*) ]] && return 1 # ❷
                typeset -ga reply
                reply=(${${:-$MARKPATH/$match[1]}:A}) # ❸
                return 0
                ;;
            *)
                return 1
                ;;
        esac
        return 0
    }

    add-zsh-hook zsh_directory_name _bookmark_directory_name

`zsh_directory_name()` is a function accepting hooks:[^hooks] instead of
defining it directly, we define another function and register it as a hook
with `add-zsh-hook`.

[^hooks]: Other functions accepting hooks are `chpwd()` or `precmd()`.

The hook is expected to handle different situations. The first one is
to be able to transform **a dynamic name into a regular directory
name**. In this case, the first parameter of the function is `n` and the
second one is the dynamic name.

In ❶, the call to `emulate` will restore the pristine behavior of
*Zsh* and also ensure that any option set in the scope of the function
will not have an impact outside. The function can then be reused
safely in another environment.

In ❷, we check that the dynamic name starts with `@` followed by at
least one character. Otherwise, we declare we don't know how to handle
it. Another hook will get the chance to do something. `(#b)` is a
*globbing flag*. It activates backreferences for parenthesised
groups. When a match is found, it is stored as an array, `$match`.

In ❸, we build the reply. We could have just returned
`$MARKPATH/$match[1]` but to hide the symbolic link mechanism, we use
the `A` modifier to ask *Zsh* to resolve symbolic links if
possible. *Zsh* allows nested substitutions. It is therefore possible
to use modifiers and flags on anything. `${:-$MARKPATH/$match[1]}` is
a common trick to turn `$MARKPATH/$match[1]` into a parameter
substitution and be able to apply the `A` modifier on it.

## Completion

*Zsh* is also able to ask for **completion of a dynamic directory
name**. In this case, the completion system calls the hook function with
`c` as the first argument.

    ::sh
    _bookmark_directory_name() {
        # […]
        case $1 in
            c)
                # Completion
                local expl
                local -a dirs
                dirs=($MARKPATH/*(N@:t)) # ❶
                dirs=("@"${^dirs}) # ❷
                _wanted dynamic-dirs expl 'bookmarked directory' compadd -S\] -a dirs
                return
                ;;
            # […]
        esac
        # […]
    }

First, in ❶, we create a list of possible bookmarks. In `*(N@:t)`,
`N@` is a *glob qualifier*. `N` allows us to not return nothing if
there is no match (otherwise, we would get an error) while `@` only
returns symbolic links. `t` is a *modifier* which will remove all
leading pathname components. This is equivalent to use `basename` or
`${something##*/}` in POSIX shells but it plays nice with glob
expressions.

In ❷, we just add `@` before each bookmark name. If we have `b1`, `b2`
and `b3` as bookmarks, `${^dirs}` expands to `{b1,b2,b3}` and
therefore `"@"${^dirs}` expands to the `(@b1 @b2 @b3)` array.

The result is then fed into the completion system.

## Prompt expansion

Many people put the name of the current directory in their prompt. It
would be nice to have the bookmark name instead of the full name when
we are below a bookmarked directory. That's also possible!

    ::console
    $ pwd
    /home/bernat/code/deezer/lldpd/src/lib
    $ echo ${(%):-%~}
    ~[@lldpd]/src/lib

The prompt expansion system calls the hook function with `d` as first
argument and the file name to transform.

    ::sh
    _bookmark_directory_name() {
        # […]
        case $1 in
            d)
                local link slink
                local -A links
                for link ($MARKPATH/*(N@)) {
                    links[${​#link:A}$'\0'${link:A}]=${link:t} # ❶
                }
                for slink (${(@On)${(k)links}}) {
                    link=${slink#*$'\0'} # ❷
                    if [​[ $2 = (​#b)(${link})(|/*) ]]; then
                        typeset -ga reply
                        reply=("@"${links[$slink]} $(( ${​#match[1]} )) )
                        return 0
                    fi
                }
                return 1
                ;;
            # […]
        esac
        # […]
    }

Okay. This is some black *Zsh* wizardry. Feel free to skip the
explanation. This is a bit complex because we want to substitute the
most specific bookmark, hence the need to sort bookmarks by their
target lengths.

In ❶, the associative array `$links` is created by iterating on each
symbolic link (`$link`) in the `$MARKPATH` directory. The goal is to
map a target directory with the matching bookmark name. However, we
need to iterate on this map from the longest to the shortest key. To
achieve that, we prepend each key with its length.

Remember, `${link:A}` is the absolute path with symbolic links
resolved. `${​#link:A}` is the length of this path. We concatenate
the length of the target directory with the target directory name and
use `$'\0'` as a separator because this is the only safe character for
this purpose. The result is mapped to the bookmark name.

The second loop is an iteration on the keys of the associative array
`$links` (thanks to the use of the `k` parameter flag in
`${(k)links}`). These keys are turned into an array (`@` parameter
flag) and sorted numerically in descending order (`On` parameter
flag). Since the keys are directory names prefixed by their lengths,
the first match will be the longest one.

In ❷, we extract the directory name from the key by removing the
length and the null character at the beginning. Then, we check if the
extracted directory name matches the file name we have been
provided. Again, `(#b)` just activates backreferences. With extended
globbing, we can use the "or" operator, `|`.

When either the file name matches exactly the directory name or is
somewhere deeper, we create the reply which is an array whose first
member is the bookmark name and the second member is the untranslated
part of the file name.

## Easy typing

Typing `~[@` is cumbersome. Hopefully, *Zsh* line editor can be extended
with additional bindings. The following snippet will substitute `@@`
(if typed without a pause) by `~[@`:

    ::sh
    vbe-insert-bookmark() {
        emulate -L zsh
        LBUFFER=${LBUFFER}"~[@"
    }
    zle -N vbe-insert-bookmark
    bindkey '@@' vbe-insert-bookmark

In combination with the `autocd` option and completion, it is quite easy to jump to a bookmarked directory.
