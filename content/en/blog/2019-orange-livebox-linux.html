title: "Replacing Orange Livebox router with a Linux box"
description: |
  Replacing Orange Livebox with another router is widely documented
  but too kludgy for my taste. I expose a cleaner setup.

A few months ago, I moved back to France and I settled for Orange as
an ISP with a bundle combining Internet and mobile subscription. In
Switzerland, I was using my [own router][] instead of the box provided
by Swisscom. While there is an [abundant documentation][] to replace
the box provided by Orange, the [instructions around a plain Linux
box][] are kludgy. I am exposing here my own variation. I am only
interested in getting IPv4/IPv6 access: no VoIP, no TV.

!!! "Update (2023-02)" Orange has [updated the DHCP options required][]. The
value sent for `rfc3118-authentication` and `dhcp6.auth` are modified. We also
need to send `dhcp-client-identifier` and `dhcp6.client-id`. This page has been
updated accordingly.

# Hardware

Orange is using [GPON][] for its FTTH deployment. Therefore, an ONT is
needed to encapsulate and decapsulate Ethernet frames into GPON
frames. Two form-factors are available. It can be small Huawei HG8010H
box also acting as a media converter to Ethernet 1000BASE-T:

"The rebranded Huawei HG8010H is acting as an ONT and media
converter")

With a recent Livebox, Orange usually provides an SFP to be plugged
inside the Livebox. For some reason I got the external ONT instead of
the SFP version. As I have a [Netgear GS110TP][] with two SFP ports, I
have bought an [SFP GPON FGS202][] on *eBay*. It is the same model
than Orange is providing with its Livebox 4. However, I did not find
the motivation to test it.[^key]

[^key]: As Orange is using the serial number to authorize the ONT, my
    plan is to call Orange customer service, pretend I have got a
    replacement and provide the new serial number.

# IPv4 configuration

Internet is provided over VLAN 832 and configured with DHCPv4. The first step is
to setup the DHCP client to send some additional information, notably the [RFC
3118][] authentication string. It includes the alphanumeric connection
identifier prefixed by `fti/` and the password provided by snail mail.
`/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf` looks like this:

    option rfc3118-authentication code 90 = string;
    interface "internet" {
      timeout 60;
      retry 1;
      select-timeout 0;
      send vendor-class-identifier "sagem";
      send user-class "+FSVDSL_livebox.Internet.softathome.Livebox4";
      # See https://jsfiddle.net/kgersen/3mnsc6wy/ to generate this string
      send rfc3118-authentication 00:00:00:00:...;
      # Use the MAC address of the Livebox
      send dhcp-client-identifier 01:00:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;
      request subnet-mask, routers,
              domain-name-servers, domain-name,
              broadcast-address,
              dhcp-lease-time, dhcp-renewal-time, dhcp-rebinding-time,
              rfc3118-authentication;
    }

Orange expects some control packets, notably DHCP, to be tagged with
802.1p PCP 6. This is a 3-bit field within the Ethernet frame when
using VLANs. By default, Linux leaves this field blank. With `ip
link`, we can translate Linux's `skb->priority` to a PCP. On Debian,
here is how to declare the VLAN interface:[^egress]

    auto internet
    iface internet inet dhcp
      pre-up    ip link add link eno1 name internet type vlan id 832 egress-qos-map 0:0 6:6
      pre-up    /etc/firewall/run
      post-down ip link del internet

[^egress]: There is no need to have the VLAN number in the interface
    name. I usually leaves them out as it doesn't help to describe the
    interface. The VLAN number can still be recovered with `ip -d link
    show`.

The last step is to add the appropriate code in `/etc/firewall/run` to
ensure DHCP, ARP, IGMP and ICMP packets have an internal priority
of 6. *Netfilter*'s `CLASSIFY` target would be the easiest solution.
However, ISC DHCP client is using raw sockets and the packets it sent
won't pass through *Netfilter*. A clean solution is to use `tc` to
modify packets just before handing them to the network card. The
[skbedit][] action allows one to change the priority associated to a
packet:[^tc]

    ::sh hl_lines="9"
    # We need a qdisc to set filters
    tc qdisc replace dev internet root handle 1: prio
    tc filter del dev internet

    # DHCP (raw sockets, do not specify "protocol ip")
    tc filter add dev internet parent 1: prio 1 u32 \
         match ip protocol 17 ff \
         match ip dport 67 ffff \
         action skbedit priority 0:6
    # ARP
    tc filter add dev internet parent 1: prio 2 protocol 0x806 u32 \
         match u32 0 0 \
         action skbedit priority 0:6
    # IGMP
    tc filter add dev internet parent 1: prio 3 protocol ip u32 \
         match ip protocol 2 ff \
         action skbedit priority 0:6
    # ICMP
    tc filter add dev internet parent 1: prio 4 protocol ip u32 \
         match ip protocol 1 ff \
         action skbedit priority 0:6

With this configuration in place, `ifup internet` should get you
connected through IPv4.

[^tc]: The first filter only works if the physical interface supports
    VLAN offloading. You can check this is the case with `ethtool -k
    eno1 | grep rx-vlan-offload`. Otherwise, the installed filter does
    not handle correctly the VLAN header and does not match the
    targeted packets.

# IPv6 configuration

Native IPv6 is also available over the same VLAN. SLAAC
autoconfiguration should be used to get a default route, but not the
IP address. Instead, Orange is providing a /56 prefix through DHCPv6
"prefix delegation."

The DHCP configuration is completed to send the DHCPv6 equivalents for
vendor class, user class and authentication string:

    # […]
    option dhcp6.auth code 11 = string;
    option dhcp6.userclass code 15 = string;
    option dhcp6.vendorclass code 16 = string;
    interface "internet" {
      timeout 60;
      retry 1;
      select-timeout 0;
      # […]
      send dhcp6.vendorclass 00:00:04:0e:00:05:73:61:67:65:6d;
      send dhcp6.userclass 00:2b:46:53:56:44:53:4c:5f:6c:69:76:65:62:6f:78:2e:49:6e:74:65:72:6e:65:74:2e:73:6f:66:74:61:74:68:6f:6d:65:2e:6c:69:76:65:62:6f:78:34;
      send dhcp6.auth 00:00:00:00:...;
      send dhcp6.client-id 00:03:00:01:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;
      also request dhcp6.auth, dhcp6.vendor-opts;
    }

The firewall script is amended to classify DHCPv6 and ICMPv6 packets
with priority 6:

    ::sh
    # DHCPv6
    tc filter add dev internet parent 1: prio 5 protocol ipv6 u32 \
         match ip6 protocol 17 ff \
         match ip6 dport 547 ffff \
         action skbedit priority 0:6
    # ICMPv6
    tc filter add dev internet parent 1: prio 6 protocol ipv6 u32 \
         match ip6 protocol 58 ff \
         action skbedit priority 0:6

The definition of the `internet` interface is updated to invoke the
DHCPv6 client:

    auto internet
    iface internet inet dhcp
      pre-up    ip link add link eno1 name internet type vlan id 832 egress-qos-map 0:0 6:6
      pre-up    /etc/firewall/run
      post-down ip link del internet
      up        /lib/ifupdown/wait-for-ll6.sh && \
                dhclient -6 -P -pf /run/dhclient6.$IFACE.pid \
                               -lf /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient6.$IFACE.leases \
                               -df /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.$IFACE.leases \
                               $IFACE
      post-down dhclient -6 -r -pf /run/dhclient6.$IFACE.pid dhclient \
                               -lf /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient6.$IFACE.leases \
                               -df /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.$IFACE.leases \
                               $IFACE || true

The `/lib/ifupdown/wait-for-ll6.sh` script waits for the interface to
get a link-local address before continuing. The `-P` option for the
DHCPv6 client enables prefix delegation and disables the normal
address query.

It is not over: the DHCPv6 client will receive a /56 prefix but there
is nothing configured to make use of it. You need to drop a [script][]
in `/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d` to actually distribute this
prefix to your internal network. Here is a simplified non-tested
version of this script:

    ::sh
    #!/bin/sh
    IA_PD_IFACES="lan-trusted lan-guest lan-games"

    case $reason in
      BOUND6|EXPIRE6|REBIND6|REBOOT6|RENEW6)
        offset=0
        for iface in $IA_PD_IFACES; do
          # Remove old /64 prefix if there is a change
          [ -n "$old_ip6_prefix" ] && \
            [ "$old_ip6_prefix" != "$new_ip6_prefix" ] && \
            ip -6 addr flush dev $iface scope global
          # Compute and add new /64 prefix
          [ -n "$new_ip6_prefix" ] && {
            offset=$((offset + 1))
            address=$(sipcalc --v6split=64 --split-verbose "$new_ip6_prefix" \
                       | grep '^Compressed' \
                       | awk "(NR == $offset)"' { print $NF }')1/64
            ! ip -6 addr show dev $iface | grep -qwF $address || \
              ip -6 addr add $address dev $iface
        done
    esac

At the top of the script, the `IA_PD_IFACES` variable contains the
list of internal interfaces. From the /56 provided in
`$new_ip6_prefix`, the script will assign a /64 to each of them—along
with the first address. For example, when being assigned
`2001:db8:f:b00::/56`, we get:

    ::console
    $ ip -brief -6 a show scope global
    lan-trusted@eno1  UP  2001:db8:f:b00::1/64
    lan-guest@eno1    UP  2001:db8:f:b01::1/64
    lan-games@eno1    UP  2001:db8:f:b02::1/64

I am using [dnsmasq][] to offer IPv6 router advertisements to hosts in
each network. This is done through the `dhcp-range` directive:

    dhcp-range=::,constructor:lan-trusted,ra-names
    dhcp-range=::,constructor:lan-guest,ra-names
    dhcp-range=::,constructor:lan-games,ra-names

The script also handles the default route by switching `accept_ra`
to 2 for the `internet` interface to accept IPv6 router advertisements
even when forwarding is enabled and sending an IPv6 router discovery
packet using [rdisc6][]:

    ::sh
    case $old_ip6_prefix,$new_ip6_prefix in
      *,)
        # No IPv6 prefix delegation, remove old route
        sysctl -qw net/ipv6/conf/$interface/accept_ra=0
        ip -6 route del default proto ra || true
        ;;
      *)
        # Otherwise, get a default route
        sysctl -qw net/ipv6/conf/$interface/accept_ra=2
        rdisc6 $interface
        ;;
    esac

Be sure to use the [complete script][script] instead of the shortened
code above! If after `ifdown internet && ifup internet`, you don't get
a /56 prefix, you may have to reboot the ONT to clear an old DHCP
lease.
