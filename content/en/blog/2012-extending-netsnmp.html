SNMP stands for [Simple Network Management Protocol][snmp]. It allows
a *manager* to query information from an *agent*. A popular use of
SNMP is to retrieve network interface counters to plot a bandwidth
graph. While the "S" in SNMP stands for *simple*, SNMP can be quite
difficult to deal with. However, it is still the *de facto* standard
for retrieving metrics in an heterogeneous
environment. [Net-SNMP][netsnmp] is a suite of SNMP applications
including an agent. Out of the box, this agent exports a lot of
information but if something is missing, there are several ways to
extend it. Which ones?

**tl;dr**: in my opinion, extending Net-SNMP should be done with
either of those methods:

 - using `extend` directive;
 - using `pass_persist` directive;
 - using AgentX protocol.

[TOC]

# SNMP in a nutshell

The *variables* accessible with SNMP through the agent are organized
in a tree. Each variable is typed and associated to an *object
identifier* (or OID). For example, `.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1.2` is the
OID of the name of the second network card.

Usually, SNMP is operated over UDP, port 161. For the purpose of this
article, we consider a manager can issue three kinds of requests:

GET
: retrieve a variable.

GETNEXT
: retrieve the next variable, in lexical order of their OID. This
  operation enables an SNMP manager to *walk* through all available
  variables, for example to discover the list of interfaces of an
  agent. This operation is what makes an SNMP agent difficult to
  implement but this is also a critical feature.

SET
: request the modification of a variable.

Since such an OID may be difficult to handle by humans, available
variables are described by a [MIB][mib] module which is a file that
should be parsed to get a mapping between OID and variable names and
types. For example, the above OID can also be referred as
`IF-MIB::ifName.2`. Those MIB modules are described using a subset of
[ASN.1][asn1] defined in [RFC 2578][rfc2578].

A MIB module allows to group several variables into a conceptual
table. For example, `IF-MIB::ifDescr`, `IF-MIB::ifType`,
`IF-MIB::ifSpeed` are columns of `IF-MIB::ifTable`. Each row is
associated to an index. In the case of `IF-MIB::ifTable`, it is the
interface index. Net-SNMP includes `snmptable` allowing one to display
such a table in a natural manner[^snmpconf]:

    ::console
    $ snmptable localhost IF-MIB::ifTable
    SNMP table: IF-MIB::ifTable                       

     ifIndex ifDescr           ifType ifMtu   ifSpeed
           1      lo softwareLoopback 16436  10000000
           2    eth0   ethernetCsmacd  1500 100000000
           3    eth1   ethernetCsmacd  1500  10000000
           4     br0   ethernetCsmacd  1500         0

[^snmpconf]: Additional arguments for `snmp*` are usually required to
             specify a version and a community (for SNMPv1 and
             SNMPv2c) or a user (for SNMPv3). In all examples, I do
             not specify anything. I assume that `~/.snmp/snmp.conf`
             contains the appropriate bits. Moreover, some outputs are
             truncated.

Variables inside a table are called *columnar objects* while those
outside are *scalar objects*. SNMP, as a protocol, does not care of
this distinction since it does not know the concept of MIB modules.

Other useful tools from Net-SNMP includes `snmpget` to get a specific
variable, `snmpwalk` to discover available variables (with *GETNEXT*
operation) from an OID and `snmptranslate` to translate between object
names and OID.

    ::console
    $ snmpget localhost IF-MIB::ifDescr.2
    IF-MIB::ifDescr.2 = STRING: eth0
    $ snmpwalk localhost IF-MIB::ifDescr
    IF-MIB::ifDescr.1 = STRING: lo
    IF-MIB::ifDescr.2 = STRING: eth0
    IF-MIB::ifDescr.3 = STRING: eth1
    IF-MIB::ifDescr.4 = STRING: br0
    $ snmpwalk -On public localhost .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2
    .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.1 = STRING: lo
    .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.2 = STRING: eth0
    .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.3 = STRING: eth1
    .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.4 = STRING: br0
    $ snmptranslate -On IF-MIB::ifDescr.3
    .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.3

# Extending Net-SNMP

`ethtool -S` allows us to access various statistics from a network
card, like the number of octets received and transmitted or the number
of collisions. While some of those statistics are defined in
[IF-MIB][rfc2233], in [RMON-MIB][rfc1757] and in
[EtherLike-MIB][rfc3635], some of them are not available and very
specific. Therefore, we would like to export those statistics,
unmodified, through SNMP.

To the best of my knowledge, no MIB module exists for such an
usage. The first task is to write one. It can be called
[ETHTOOL-MIB][ethtool-mib]. It only contains one table indexed by the
interface index and the name of the statistic. Here is the expected output:

    ::console
    $ snmpwalk localhost ETHTOOL-MIB::ethtoolStat.2
    ethtoolStat.2.'align_errors' = Counter64: 0
    ethtoolStat.2.'broadcast' = Counter64: 25
    ethtoolStat.2.'multicast' = Counter64: 345
    ethtoolStat.2.'rx_errors' = Counter64: 0
    ethtoolStat.2.'rx_missed' = Counter64: 0
    ethtoolStat.2.'rx_packets' = Counter64: 262011
    ethtoolStat.2.'tx_aborted' = Counter64: 0
    ethtoolStat.2.'tx_errors' = Counter64: 0
    ethtoolStat.2.'tx_multi_collisions' = Counter64: 0
    ethtoolStat.2.'tx_packets' = Counter64: 296170
    ethtoolStat.2.'tx_single_collisions' = Counter64: 0
    ethtoolStat.2.'tx_underrun' = Counter64: 0
    ethtoolStat.2.'unicast' = Counter64: 261641

I have coded various implementations of this MIB module and made them
available in a [GitHub repository][extend-netsnmp].

## With arbitrary commands

The `extend` directive allows the agent to execute an arbitrary
command and to provide its output and status through
`NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB` module. If we want to export the statistics for
`eth0`, we could add something like this in `snmpd.conf`, using a
[custom script][ethtool-stats] to format the output of `ethtool -S` in
a way that is more suitable for our use:

    ::conf
    # Export eth0 statistics
    extend eth0-names  /full/path/to/ethtool-stats eth0 names
    extend eth0-values /full/path/to/ethtool-stats eth0 values

The result can be retrieved through
`NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::‌nsExtendOutput2Table`:

    ::console
    $ snmpwalk localhost NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput2Table
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-names".1 = STRING: tx_packets
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-names".2 = STRING: rx_packets
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-names".3 = STRING: tx_errors
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-names".4 = STRING: rx_errors
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-names".5 = STRING: rx_missed
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-names".6 = STRING: align_errors
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-names".7 = STRING: tx_single_collisions
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-names".8 = STRING: tx_multi_collisions
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-values".1 = STRING: 246309
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-values".2 = STRING: 223941
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-values".3 = STRING: 0
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-values".4 = STRING: 0
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-values".5 = STRING: 0
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-values".6 = STRING: 0
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-values".7 = STRING: 0
    nsExtendOutLine."eth0-values".8 = STRING: 0

It is also possible to configure such a command using *SET*
requests. For example, if we want to add statistics for `eth2`, we
could issue the following command:

    ::console
    $ snmpset -m +NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB localhost \
    >    'nsExtendStatus."eth2-names"'  = createAndGo \
    >    'nsExtendCommand."eth2-names"' = /full/path/to/ethtool-stats \
    >    'nsExtendArgs."eth2-names"'    = 'eth2 names' \
    >    'nsExtendStatus."eth2-values"'  = createAndGo \
    >    'nsExtendCommand."eth2-values"' = /full/path/to/ethtool-stats \
    >    'nsExtendArgs."eth2-values"'    = 'eth2 values'
    nsExtendStatus."eth2-names" = INTEGER: createAndGo(4)
    nsExtendCommand."eth2-names" = STRING: /full/path/to/ethtool-stats
    nsExtendArgs."eth2-names" = STRING: eth2 names
    nsExtendStatus."eth2-values" = INTEGER: createAndGo(4)
    nsExtendCommand."eth2-values" = STRING: /full/path/to/ethtool-stats
    nsExtendArgs."eth2-values" = STRING: eth2 values
    $ snmpgetnext -m +NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB localhost \
    >    'nsExtendOutLine."eth2-names"'
    nsExtendOutLine."eth2-names".1 = STRING: tx_packets

This can be very convenient but also a huge security risk. You should
disable this functionality or
[enable it only for some SNMPv3 user][snmpd-secure].

Using `extend` does not allow to implement an arbitrary MIB module. If
the cache is not disabled, `extend` is a good solution for various
simple needs, like providing the content of a one-line file or the
output of some Nagios plugin. However, exporting anything tabular,
like interface statistics, is not a good fit.

## With pass-through scripts

Net-SNMP allows one to extend the agent by delegating some sub-tree to
a script defined by the `pass_persist` directive. Such a script will
receive requests on its standard input with a very simple
line-oriented protocol described in the
[manual page of snmpd.conf][snmpd.conf]. Here is an example of
interaction:

    ::text
    →  PING
    ←  PONG
    →  get
    →  .1.3.6.1.4.1.39178.100.1.1.1.2.2.109.117.108.116.105.99.97.115.116
    ←  .1.3.6.1.4.1.39178.100.1.1.1.2.2.109.117.108.116.105.99.97.115.116
    ←  counter64
    ←  223941
    →  getnext
    →  .1.3.6.1.4.1.39178.100.1.1.1.2.2
    ←  .1.3.6.1.4.1.39178.100.1.1.1.2.2.97.108.105.103.110.95.101.114
    ←  counter64
    ←  0

The protocol is simple enough to implement it from scratch in any
scripting language. However, in Perl, you may prefer to use
[SNMP::‌ExtensionSNMP::‌PassPersist][passperl] extension from Sébastien
Aperghis-Tramoni. You can find the
[complete example on Github][ethtool-stats.pl].

    ::perl
    use SNMP::Extension::PassPersist;
    my $extsnmp = SNMP::Extension::PassPersist->new(
        backend_collect => \&update_tree
        );
    $extsnmp->run;

    sub update_tree {
        my @interfaces = </sys/class/net/*>;
        foreach my $interface (@interfaces) {
            $interface =~ s/^.*\///;
            open(ETHTOOL, "ethtool -S $interface 2>/dev/null |") or next;
            while (<ETHTOOL>) {
                /^\s+(\w+): (\d+)$/ or next;
                my $name  = $1;
                my $value = int($2);
                my $oid   = oid_compute($interface, $name);
                $extsnmp->add_oid_entry($oid, "counter", $value);
            }
            close(ETHTOOL);
        }
    }

With Python, [snmp-passpersist][passpython] module, from Nicolas
Agius, provides a similar interface. Look at the
[complete example on GitHub][ethtool-stats.py].

`pass_persist` allows you to implement an arbitrary MIB module with
honest performances. Here are some important things to know about this
directive:

 - Unless you have a recent version of Net-SNMP, 64bit types are
   converted to 32bit equivalents. The counters may overflow quickly.
 - While handling a request, you are not allowed to pause (for
   example, to fetch a remote information): the agent would become
   unresponsive. If you need slow-to-get data or data from the agent,
   grab them in a separate thread and ensure you have them
   beforehand.

## With AgentX protocol

AgentX is a protocol defined in [RFC 2741][rfc2741] allowing a *master
agent* to be extended by independent *sub-agents*. For `snmpd` to
become a master agent, you just need to add `master agentx` in
`snmpd.conf`. Here are some of the benefits of an AgentX sub-agent over
`pass_persist`:

 1. No configuration is needed for the master agent to accept an
    additional sub-agent. A sub-agent registers to the master agent
    the MIB modules (or part of them) it wants to take care of.
 3. A sub-agent is decoupled from the master agent. It can run with a
    different identity or be integrated into another daemon to export
    its internal metrics, send traps or allow remote configuration
    through SNMP.
 4. AgentX protocol can be carried over TCP. Sub-agents can therefore
    run on a foreign host or in a jailed environment.
 5. 64bit types are fully supported. Traps are also supported.

### Perl and Python

Net-SNMP provides a Perl module, `NetSNMP::agent`, to write a sub-agent
using AgentX protocol. This module is not as convenient as the module
for `pass_persist` described above since it does not provide a
convenient layer to put required information into some
datastore. Basically, it mimics the available C API. Here are a few
examples of its use:

 - An [implementation of ETHTOOL-MIB][ethtool-stats-agentx.pl] I have
   done in the same way as the `pass_persist` version. My Perl skills
   are a bit rusty and the code has many rough edges.
 - An [implementation of a sub-agent for Redis servers][redis-snmp].
 - An [implementation of BRIDGE-MIB][bridge-snmp] shipped with Net-SNMP.

There is no similar binding for Python but there is an
[agentx extension][python-agentx] using `ctypes`. It provides a more
high-level view. I did not write an example for this one but you can
look at the [example provided by the author][python-agentx-example].

### C with "new" API

To write a sub-agent in C, you have to choose between two API:

 1. the API inherited from UCD-SNMP also known as the "traditional"
    API;
 2. the new API developed for Net-SNMP 5.x.

With both API, an handler is registered to take care of one or several
sub-trees. With the traditional API, the handler is invoked with very
little information. It is then up to you to locate the appropriate
variable by mapping the index part of the OID to the objects you want
to export. It is quite simple for scalar objects but columnar objects
with complex indexes are a pain with such an API.

The new API provides various helpers. Some of them allow you to copy
objects into an array or a list and let Net-SNMP library do the hard
work of serving them. Another helper will provide methods to serve
objects without putting them in a special structure but by providing
an iterator. Some of those helpers can also help you to cache some
variables.

On top of this new API, Net-SNMP comes with `mib2c`, a tool that will
help you convert a MIB module into C code: after a few questions, you
will get a skeleton C code you will have to complete with the logic to
retrieve real objects. A generated file also provides directions on
what to do (with some magic command to have a step-by-step cookbook).

I was able to implement `ETHTOOL-MIB` by just running it through
`mib2c`, choosing the table container helper with cache and adding
some code in `ethtoolStatTable_data_access.c`. You can look at the
[result on Github][ethtool-mib2c]. Here is a stripped-down
version[^strip] of what has been modified:

    ::c
    /* Socket for ioctl */
    skfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);

    /* Iterate through all interfaces */
    getifaddrs(&ifap);
    for (ifa = ifap; ifa != NULL; ifa = ifa->ifa_next) {
        /* Grab statistics name and values */
        strcpy(ifr.ifr_name, ifa->ifa_name);
        drvinfo.cmd         = ETHTOOL_GDRVINFO;
        ifr.ifr_data        = (caddr_t) &drvinfo;
        ioctl(skfd, SIOCETHTOOL, &ifr);
        n_stats             = drvinfo.n_stats;
        strings->cmd        = ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS;
        strings->string_set = ETH_SS_STATS;
        strings->len        = n_stats;
        ifr.ifr_data        = (caddr_t) strings;
        ioctl(skfd, SIOCETHTOOL, &ifr);
        stats->cmd          = ETHTOOL_GSTATS;
        stats->n_stats      = n_stats;
        ifr.ifr_data        = (caddr_t) stats;
        ioctl(skfd, SIOCETHTOOL, &ifr);

        ifIndex = if_nametoindex(ifa->ifa_name);

        /* Iterate through statistics */
        for (i = 0; i < n_stats; i++) {

            /* Declare the appropriate index */
            strncpy(ethtoolStatName,
                    (char *)&strings->data[i * ETH_GSTRING_LEN],
                    ETH_GSTRING_LEN);
            ethtoolStatName[sizeof(ethtoolStatName) - 1] = '\0';
            ethtoolStatName_len = strlen(ethtoolStatName);

            /* Append this new variable to the container. */
            rowreq_ctx = ethtoolStatTable_allocate_rowreq_ctx();
            ethtoolStatTable_indexes_set(rowreq_ctx,
                        ifIndex,
                        ethtoolStatName, ethtoolStatName_len);
            rowreq_ctx->data.ethtoolStat.high = stats->data[i] >> 32;
            rowreq_ctx->data.ethtoolStat.low = (uint32_t)stats->data[i];

            CONTAINER_INSERT(container, rowreq_ctx);
        }
    }

[^strip]: No allocations, no variable declarations and no error
          checkings. Do not do this at home!

See? It is pretty easy. I have only enumerated all the objects I
wanted to expose. I didn't even have to convert statistics names to an
OID, `mib2c` built a `ethtoolStatTable_indexes_set()` for this
purpose. OpenHPI project provides an
[extensive documentation to write a sub-agent][subagent-manual] this
way.

Now, on the downside, to implement a **single table**, I have **14
generated files** whose code style is usually unfit to integrate
into an existing project : some people, me included, do not like
automatically generated code, all the more when it is so verbose. The
solution would be to use the new API without `mib2c`; unfortunately,
while the [documentation exists][netsnmp-api], all provided examples
rely exclusively on `mib2c` tool. Unless you are able to grasp the new
API without it, I would restrict its use to two cases:

 - Writing a new module for inclusion into Net-SNMP. Since most
   modules are now written with the help of `mib2c`, there is no
   coding style problem.
 - Writing a standalone sub-agent for some MIB. As a standalone
   project, you won't run into coding style problems either.

For other uses, let's have a look at the traditional API.

### C with "traditional" API

The traditional API is way simpler and even if it is quite old, it is
easier to find associated examples. Here is how to initialize the
agent, again, in a stripped-down version (the
[complete version is on GitHub][ethtool-agentx]):

    ::c
    static oid ethtool_oid[] = {1, 3, 6, 1, 4, 1, 39178, 100, 1};
    static struct variable3 ethtool_vars[] = {
      {1, ASN_COUNTER64, RONLY, ethtool_stat, 3, {1, 1, 2}}
    };

    int main()
    {
      netsnmp_enable_subagent();
      snmp_disable_log();
      snmp_enable_stderrlog();
      init_agent("ethtoolAgent");
      REGISTER_MIB("ethtoolStatTable", ethtool_vars,
                   variable3, ethtool_oid);
      init_snmp("ethtoolAgent");
      while (1)
        agent_check_and_process(1);
    }

The `REGISTER_MIB()` macro is used to register the provided root OID
(`ethtool_oid`) to the master agent. It also registers handlers
associated to various sub-OID through the `ethtool_vars[]` array. Each
member of this array features the following fields:

 - `magic` is an integer allowing one to discriminate OID handled by
   the same handler. For a table, this allows to handle several
   columns with the same handler since they share a common index.
 - `type` is the type of the variable that will be returned.
 - `acl` tells if the object is read-only (`RONLY`) or read-write
   (`RWRITE`).
 - `findVar` is the handler associated to the object. Its task will be
   to find the appropriate object and return its value.
 - The two last fields are the relative OID this entry is responsible
   for along with its length.

The prototype of `ethtool_stat()` handler function is the following:

    ::c
    static u_char*
    ethtool_stat(struct variable *vp, oid *name, size_t *length,
                 int exact, size_t *var_len, WriteMethod **write_method);

This function should return the value of the requested variable or
`NULL` if no appropriate object was found. The value can be statically
stored since it will be copied. Here is the description of the
arguments:

 - `struct variable *vp` is the structure the handle was associated
   with, except that `vp->name` is now a full OID, not a relative
   one. You can access `vp->magic` to determine which column or which
   scalar to handle if this handler is common to several objects.
 - `oid *name` and `size_t *length` describe the OID requested. If you
   want to return another OID (for a *GETNEXT* request for example), you
   can modify them. `name` points to an OID array large enough to fit
   any OID you want to return.
 - `int exact` tells if the requested OID should be exactly matched
   (case of *GET* or *SET*) or not (*GETNEXT*).
 - `size_t *var_len` is used to tell the size of the returned
   object.
 - `WriteMethod **write_method` is only used if the variable is
   modifiable. When a *SET* request is received, the API will call the
   handler with `exact` set to 1 and expects to get a pointer to the
   function that will handle the write operation[^write].

[^write]: If you want to look at an example of how to handle a *SET*
          request, look at the
          [SNMP support for Keepalived][keepalived-snmp-vrrp]. A *SET*
          operation is more complex because SNMP ensures that the
          *SET* operation is atomic across all provided variables. It
          uses a three-staged commit. The traditional API is very
          inefficient for this kind of operation because the object
          has to be located again for each step.

To implement this function, you are on your own. When relying on
externally fetched data, you need to handle a cache yourself. I have
used a red-black tree for this purpose (with code stolen from
OpenBSD). This also enables an easy implementation of the *GETNEXT*
operation.

Here are three projects using this API to provide SNMP support:

 - [Keepalived][keepalived] is a VRRP daemon and a monitoring daemon
   for LVS clusters. I have
   [added a complete SNMP support][keepalived-snmp]. The most
   interesting files are [core/snmp.c][keepalived-snmp-core],
   [check/check_snmp.c][keepalived-snmp-check] and
   [vrrp/vrrp_snmp.c][keepalived-snmp-vrrp]. It features a tight
   integration into Keepalived event loop that should be reusable by
   other projects. It includes read-only support of all data
   structures (configuration, state and statistics), ability to send
   traps on events and a write support for some values.
 - [lldpd][lldpd] is an implementation of 802.1AB (LLDP) which is a
   protocol allowing an equipment to advertise itself to its neighbors
   on Ethernet level. 802.1AB comes with a huge MIB module and many
   extensions. *lldpd* provides a fairly complete read-only
   implementation of this MIB module. Some tables have complex
   indexes. Have a look at [agent.c][lldpd-snmp]. There is currently
   no write support and no traps but *lldpd* features privilege
   separation and some code allows it to still use an Unix socket to
   speak with the master agent.
 - [Asterisk][asterisk], an open source PBX, includes an AgentX
   sub-agent allowing one to grab some metrics. Look at
   [res/snmp/agent.c][asterisk-snmp].

**UPDATED:** If it is critical for your project to *not* block, you
should be aware that using NetSNMP implementation of AgentX has some
issues. Have a look at my [other post on this topic][fixing].

## Other solutions

The manual page for [snmpd.conf][snmpd.conf] explores other ways to
extend Net-SNMP agent under the section "*Extending agent
functionality*":

 - `exec` and `sh` are deprecated. Use `extend` instead.
 - `pass` is a bit simpler than `pass_persist`. The command is run
   once for each request. Such a command can easily be turned into a
   `pass_persist` script. Moreover, Net-SNMP will not answer any
   request while a `pass` command is running.
 - `proxy` redirects requests to another SNMP agent. Unless you have
   some code that can only act as a complete SNMP agent, it is better
   to use AgentX instead. For programs using Net-SNMP API, turning an
   agent into an AgentX sub-agent is just one line of code. Since a
   sub-agent involves less code than a complete agent, it is more
   efficient and more reliable.
 - `smux` has been superseeded by AgentX.
 - `perl` and `dlmod` allow one to load and execute external code
   inside the running agent. Unless you have important performance
   requirements, it is better to use a sub-agent instead: if some bug
   happens, only the sub-agent will be affected, not the master
   agent. A sub-agent sticks more closely to the Unix philosophy:
   "write programs that do one thing and do it well". However,
   [Net-SNMP FAQ][faqwhich] says:

> Implementing the module in C within the main agent (directly or via
> `dlmod`) is probably the most efficient and reliable, closely followed
> by embedded perl (or python) extensions.  These have the advantage
> of minimal overheads between the code implementing the MIB module,
> and the agent framework, and no inter-process communication issues.
