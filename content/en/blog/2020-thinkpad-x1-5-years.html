I have recently replaced my **ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2014** (second
generation). I have kept it for more than five years, using it every
day and carrying it everywhere. The expected lifetime of a laptop is
always [unknown][]. Let me share my feedback.

![ThinkPad X1 Carbon with the lid closed]([[!!images/x1c-2nd/closed@2x.jpg]]
"ThinkPad X1 Carbon 20A7 with its lid closed")

My [configuration][] embeds an Intel vPro Core i7-4600U, 8 Gib of RAM, a
256 Gib SATA SSD, a matte WQHD display, and a WWAN LTE card. I got it in
June 2014. It has spent these years running Debian Sid, starting from
Linux 3.14 to Linux 5.4.

![Inside the X1 Carbon]([[!!images/x1c-2nd/inside@2x.jpg]] "The inside
is still quite dust-free! In the bottom left, there is the Intel WLAN
card, the Sierra WWAN card as well as the SSD.")

This generation of ThinkPad X1 Carbon has been subject to a variety of
experiences around the **keyboard**. We are still hunting the
culprits. The layout is messed up, with many keys displaced.[^layout]
I have [remapped][] most of them. It also lacks physical function
keys: they have been replaced by a non-customizable touch bar. I do
not like it due to the absence of tactile feedback and it is quite easy to
hit a key by mistake. I would recommend not buying this generation as
a second-hand device because of this.

[^layout]: The Swiss-German layout may not help, but I didn't care
    much about what is written on the keycaps.

![ThinkPad X1 Carbon keyboard with an odd layout and a touch
bar]([[!!images/x1c-2nd/keyboard@2x.jpg]] "The keyboard layout is
maddening: check the “Home”, “End”, “Esc” and “Backspace” keys. The
backquote key is between “AltGr” and right “Ctrl” while it should be
where the “Esc” is. The touch bar is not very usable and shows
significant signs of wear.")

The **screen** is a WQHD display 2560x1440 (210 DPI). In 2014, Linux
HiDPI support was in its infancy. This has [not changed that much for
X11][] and the 1.5× factor is still a challenge: fonts can be scaled
correctly, but many applications won't adapt their interfaces.
However, my most used applications are a terminal, Emacs, and Firefox.
They handle this fractional factor without issue. As the power usage
of a 4K display is significantly higher, in my opinion, a WQHD screen
still is the perfect balance for a laptop: you get crisp texts while
keeping power usage low.

After two or three years, white spots have started appearing on the
screen. They are noticeable when displaying a uniform color. This
seems a common problem due to pressure when the laptop sits closed in
a bag. Most of the time, I don't pay attention to this defect. Lenovo
did not acknowledge this issue but agrees to replace the screen
under warranty.

background on right]([[!!images/x1c-2nd/screen@2x.jpg]] "After several
years, the screen exhibits several white spots. The effect is not as
strong when sitting just in front and hardly noticeable when not
displaying a solid color.")

The **battery** was replaced three years ago as a precautionary
measure. I am still able to get around four hours from it despite its
wear—65% of its design capacity. During the years, Linux became more
power-efficient. In the beginning, `powertop` was reporting around
10 W of power usage when the screen brightness is at 20%, with Emacs,
Firefox, and a few terminals running. With a 5.4 kernel, I now get
around 7 W in the same conditions.

The laptop contains a *Sierra Wireless EM7345 4G LTE* **WWAN card**.
It is supported by *Modem Manager* when operating as an MBIM device.
In the early days, the card dropped the network every 20 minutes. A
firmware upgrade solved this reliability issue. This is not an easy
task as you need to find the [right firmware][] for your card and the
right tool to flash it. At the time, I was only able to do that with
Windows. I don't recommend using a WWAN card anymore. They are black
boxes with unreliable firmware. I had the same kind of issues with
the Qualcomm Gobi 2000 WWAN card present in my [previous ThinkPad
laptop][]. Lenovo switched from Sierra to Fibocom for the recent
generations of ThinkPad and they are even more difficult to use with
Linux, despite being manufactured by Intel. It is less trouble using
a phone as a wireless hotspot.

At work, I was plugging the laptop into a **dock**, a ThinkPad OneLink
Pro Dock. The proprietary connector for the dock combines power, USB3,
and DisplayPort. The dock features both a DisplayPort and a DVI-I
connector and acts as an MST hub. The support of such a configuration
was pretty recent in Linux since it has been added in version 3.17
(October 2014). Over the years, I didn't run into much trouble with
this dock.

ThinkPad OneLink Pro Dock, featuring two USB3 ports, two USB2 ports,
one Ethernet port, one DisplayPort, and a DVI-I connector. The front
face features two USB3 ports and an audio jack.")

In summary, after five years of daily use, the laptop is still in good
working condition. Only the screen and the touch bar show major signs
of wear. Therefore, Lenovo keeps my trust in building durable and
reliable laptops. I have replaced it with [another ThinkPad X1 Carbon][].
