title: "Automatic login with startx and systemd"
description: |
  Instead of using a display manager to autologin into
  an Xorg session on boot, we can use startx and systemd.

If your workstation is using [full-disk encryption][], you may want to
jump directly to your desktop environment after entering the
passphrase to decrypt the disk. Many display managers like [GDM][] and
[LightDM][] have an autologin feature. However, only *GDM* can run
*Xorg* with standard user privileges.

Here is an alternative using `startx` and a *systemd* service:

    ::ini
    [Unit]
    Description=X11 session for bernat
    After=graphical.target systemd-user-sessions.service

    [Service]
    User=bernat
    WorkingDirectory=~

    PAMName=login
    Environment=XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11
    TTYPath=/dev/tty8
    StandardInput=tty
    UnsetEnvironment=TERM

    UtmpIdentifier=tty8
    UtmpMode=user

    StandardOutput=journal
    ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/chvt 8
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/startx -- vt8 -keeptty -verbose 3 -logfile /dev/null
    Restart=no

    [Install]
    WantedBy=graphical.target

Let me explain each block:

- The unit starts after `systemd-user-sessions.service`, which enables
  user logins after boot by removing the `/run/nologin` file.

- With `User=bernat`, the unit is started with the identity of the
  specified user. This implies that `Xorg` does not run with elevated
  privileges.

- With `PAMName=login`, the executed process is registered as a PAM
  session for the `login` service, which includes [pam_systemd][].
  This module registers the session to the [systemd login manager][].
  To be effective, we also need to allocate a TTY with
  `TTYPath=/dev/tty8`. When the TTY is active, the user is granted
  additional access to local devicesâ€”notably display, sound, keyboard,
  mouse. These additional rights are needed to get *Xorg* working
  rootless.[^moredoc] The `TERM` environment variable is unset because
  it would be set to `linux` by *systemd* as a result of attaching the
  standard input to the TTY. Moreover, we inform `pam_systemd` we want
  an X11 session with `Environment=XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11`. Otherwise,
  `logind` considers the session idle unless it receives input on
  the TTY. Software relying on the idle hint from `logind` would be
  ineffective.[^xcoulddo2]

- The `UtmpIdentifier=tty8` and `UtmpMode=user` directives are just
  a nice addition to register the session in `/var/run/utmp`.

- The last step is to execute `Xorg` through `startx`. For `logind` to
  allow `Xorg` to take control of the local devices, `chvt 8` switches
  to the allocated TTY.[^xcoulddo] `StandardOutput=journal`, combined
  with the `-verbose 3 -logfile /dev/null` flags for `Xorg`, puts the
  logs from the X server into the journal instead of using a file.
  While equal to the default value, the `Restart=no` directive
  highlights we do not want this unit to be restarted. This ensures
  the loginless session is only available on boot. By default,
  `startx` runs `xinitrc`. If you want to run *Kodi* instead, add
  `/usr/bin/kodi-standalone` between `startx` and `--`.

[^moredoc]: For more information on how `logind` provides access to
    devices, see this [blog post][]. The method names do not match the
    current implementation, but the concepts are still correct. `Xorg`
    takes control of the session when the TTY is active.

[^xcoulddo2]: *Xorg* could change the type of the session itself after
    taking control of it, but it [does not][].

[^xcoulddo]: There is some code in *Xorg* to do that, but it is
    executed too late and fails with: `xf86OpenConsole: VT_ACTIVATE
    failed: Operation not permitted`.

Drop this unit in `/etc/systemd/system/x11-autologin.service` and
enable it with `systemctl enable x11-autologin.service`. *Xorg* is now
running rootless and logging into the journal. After using it for a
few months, I didn't notice any regression compared to *LightDM* with
autologin.
