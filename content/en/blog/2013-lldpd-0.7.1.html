A few weeks ago, a new version of [lldpd][], a 802.1AB (aka LLDP)
implementation for various Unices, has been released.

[LLDP][] is an industry standard protocol designed to supplant
proprietary Link-Layer protocols such as EDP or CDP. The goal of LLDP
is to provide an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver
Link-Layer notifications to adjacent network devices.

In short, LLDP allows you to know exactly on which port is a server
(and reciprocally). To illustrate its use, I have made a [xkcd][]-like
strip:

![xkcd-like strip for the use of LLDP][why]

If you would like more information about _lldpd_, please have a look
at [its new dedicated website][lldpd]. This blog post is an insight of
various **technical changes** that have affected _lldpd_ since its
latest major release one year ago. Lots of C stuff ahead!

# Version & changelog

**UPDATED:** [Guillem Jover][] told me how he met the same goals for
[libbsd][] :

 1. Save the version from git into `.dist-version` and use this file
    if it exists. This allows one to rebuild `./configure` from the
    published tarball without losing the version. This also handles
    [Thorsten Glaser's critic][tg].
 2. Include `CHANGELOG` in `DISTCLEANFILES` variable.

Since this is a better solution, I have [adopted][] the appropriate
line of codes from _libbsd_. The two following sections are partly
technically outdated.

## Automated version

In `configure.ac`, I was previously using a static version number that
I had to increase when releasing:

    ::raw
    AC_INIT([lldpd], [0.5.7], [bernat@luffy.cx])

Since the information is present in the git tree, this seems a bit
redundant (and easy to forget). Taking the version from the git tree
is easy:

    ::raw
    AC_INIT([lldpd],
            [m4_esyscmd_s([git describe --tags --always --match [0-9]* 2> /dev/null || date +%F])],
            [bernat@luffy.cx])

If the head of the git tree is tagged, you get the exact tag (`0.7.1`
for example). If it is not, you get the nearest one, the number of
commits since it and part of the current hash (`0.7.1-29-g2909519` for
example).

The drawback of this approach is that if you rebuild `configure`
from the released tarball, you don't have the git tree and the version
will be a date. Just don't do that.

## Automated changelog

Generating the changelog from git is a common practice. I had some
difficulties to make it right. Here is my attempt (I am using
`automake`):

    ::make
    dist_doc_DATA = README.md NEWS ChangeLog
    
    .PHONY: $(distdir)/ChangeLog
    dist-hook: $(distdir)/ChangeLog
    $(distdir)/ChangeLog:
            $(AM_V_GEN)if test -d $(top_srcdir)/.git; then \
              prev=$$(git describe --tags --always --match [0-9]* 2> /dev/null) ; \
              for tag in $$(git tag | grep -E '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+){1,}$$' | sort -rn); do \
                if [ x"$$prev" = x ]; then prev=$$tag ; fi ; \
                if [ x"$$prev" = x"$$tag" ]; then continue; fi ; \
                echo "$$prev [$$(git log $$prev -1 --pretty=format:'%ai')]:" ; \
                echo "" ; \
                git log --pretty=' - [%h] %s (%an)' $$tag..$$prev ; \
                echo "" ; \
                prev=$$tag ; \
              done > $@ ; \
            else \
              touch $@ ; \
            fi
    ChangeLog:
            touch $@

Changelog entries are grouped by version. Since it is a bit verbose, I
still maintain a `NEWS` file with important changes.

# Core

## C99

I have recently read [21st Century C][] which has some good bits and
also handles the ecosystem around C. I have definitively adopted
[designated initializers][] in my coding style. Being a GCC extension
since a long time, this is not a major compatibility problem.

Without designated initializers:

    ::c
    struct netlink_req req;
    struct iovec iov;
    struct sockaddr_nl peer;
    struct msghdr rtnl_msg;
    
    memset(&req, 0, sizeof(req));
    memset(&iov, 0, sizeof(iov));
    memset(&peer, 0, sizeof(peer));
    memset(&rtnl_msg, 0, sizeof(rtnl_msg));
    
    req.hdr.nlmsg_len = NLMSG_LENGTH(sizeof(struct rtgenmsg));
    req.hdr.nlmsg_type = RTM_GETLINK;
    req.hdr.nlmsg_flags = NLM_F_REQUEST | NLM_F_DUMP;
    req.hdr.nlmsg_seq = 1;
    req.hdr.nlmsg_pid = getpid();
    req.gen.rtgen_family = AF_PACKET;
    iov.iov_base = &req;
    iov.iov_len = req.hdr.nlmsg_len;
    peer.nl_family = AF_NETLINK;
    rtnl_msg.msg_iov = &iov;
    rtnl_msg.msg_iovlen = 1;
    rtnl_msg.msg_name = &peer;
    rtnl_msg.msg_namelen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_nl);

With designated initializers:

    ::c
    struct netlink_req req = {
        .hdr = {
            .nlmsg_len = NLMSG_LENGTH(sizeof(struct rtgenmsg)),
            .nlmsg_type = RTM_GETLINK,
            .nlmsg_flags = NLM_F_REQUEST | NLM_F_DUMP,
            .nlmsg_seq = 1,
            .nlmsg_pid = getpid() },
        .gen = { .rtgen_family = AF_PACKET }
    };
    struct iovec iov = {
        .iov_base = &req,
        .iov_len = req.hdr.nlmsg_len
    };
    struct sockaddr_nl peer = { .nl_family = AF_NETLINK };
    struct msghdr rtnl_msg = {
        .msg_iov = &iov,
        .msg_iovlen = 1,
        .msg_name = &peer,
        .msg_namelen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_nl)
    };

## Logging

Logging in _lldpd_ was not extensive. Usually, when receiving a bug
report, I asked the reporter to add some additional `printf()` calls
to determine where the problem was. This was clearly
suboptimal. Therefore, I have added many `log_debug()` calls with the
ability to filter out some of them. For example, to debug interface
discovery, one can run _lldpd_ with `lldpd -ddd -D interface`.

Moreover, I have added colors when logging to a terminal. This may
seem pointless but it is now far easier to spot warning messages from
debug ones.

![logging output of lldpd][lldpd-logging]
[lldpd-logging]: [[!!images/lldpd-logging.png]] "Example of colored logging output for lldpd"

## libevent

In _lldpd_ 0.5.7, I was using my own `select()`-based event loop. It
worked but I didn't want to grow a full-featured event loop inside
_lldpd_. Therefore, I switched to [libevent][].

The minimal required version of _libevent_ is 2.0.5. A convenient way
to check the changes in API is to use [Upstream Tracker][], a website
tracking API and ABI changes for various libraries. This version of
_libevent_ is not available in many stable distributions. For example,
Debian Squeeze or Ubuntu Lucid only have
1.4.13. I am also trying to keep compatibility with very old
distributions, like RHEL 2, which does not have a packaged _libevent_
at all.

For some users, it may be a burden to compile additional
libraries. Therefore, I have included _libevent_ source code in
_lldpd_ source tree (as a git submodule) and I am only using it if no
suitable system _libevent_ is available.

Have a look at [`m4/libevent.m4`][m4/libevent.m4] and
[`src/daemon/Makefile.am`][src/daemon/Makefile.am] to see how this is
done.

# Client

## Serialization

`lldpctl` is a client querying `lldpd` to display discovered
neighbors. The communication is done through an Unix socket. Each
structure to be serialized over this socket should be described with a
string. For example:

    ::c
    #define STRUCT_LLDPD_DOT3_MACPHY "(bbww)"
    struct lldpd_dot3_macphy {
            u_int8_t                 autoneg_support;
            u_int8_t                 autoneg_enabled;
            u_int16_t                autoneg_advertised;
            u_int16_t                mau_type;
    };

I did not want to use stuff like [Protocol Buffers][] because I didn't
want to copy the existing structures to other structures before
serialization (and the other way after deserialization).

However, the serializer in _lldpd_ did not allow to handle reference
to other structures, lists or circular references. I have written
another one which works by annotating a structure with some
macros:

    ::c
    struct lldpd_chassis {
        TAILQ_ENTRY(lldpd_chassis) c_entries;
        u_int16_t        c_index;
        u_int8_t         c_protocol;
        u_int8_t         c_id_subtype;
        char            *c_id;
        int              c_id_len;
        char            *c_name;
        char            *c_descr;

        u_int16_t        c_cap_available;
        u_int16_t        c_cap_enabled;

        u_int16_t        c_ttl;

        TAILQ_HEAD(, lldpd_mgmt) c_mgmt;
    };
    MARSHAL_BEGIN(lldpd_chassis)
    MARSHAL_TQE  (lldpd_chassis, c_entries)
    MARSHAL_FSTR (lldpd_chassis, c_id, c_id_len)
    MARSHAL_STR  (lldpd_chassis, c_name)
    MARSHAL_STR  (lldpd_chassis, c_descr)
    MARSHAL_SUBTQ(lldpd_chassis, lldpd_mgmt, c_mgmt)
    MARSHAL_END;

Only pointers need to be annotated. The remaining of the structure can
be serialized with just `memcpy()`[^uint16t]. I think there is still
room for improvement. It should be possible to add annotations inside
the structure and avoid some duplication. Or maybe, using a
[C parser][pycparser]? Or using the AST output from LLVM?

[^uint16t]: Therefore, the use of `u_int16_t` and `u_int8_t` types is
            a left-over of the previous serializer where the size of
            all members was important.

## Library

In _lldpd_ 0.5.7, there are two possible entry points to interact
with the daemon:

 1. Through SNMP support. Only information available in [LLDP-MIB][]
    are exported. Therefore, implementation-specific values are
    not available. Moreover, SNMP support is currently read-only.
 2. Through `lldpctl`. Thanks to a contribution from Andreas
    Hofmeister, the output can be requested to be formatted as an XML
    document.

Integration of _lldpd_ into a network stack was therefore limited to one
of those two channels. As an exemple, you can have a look at
[how Vyatta made the integration][] using the second solution.

To provide a more robust solution, I have added a shared library,
`liblldpctl`, with a stable and well-defined API. `lldpctl` is now
using it. I have followed those directions[^library]:

 - Consistent naming (all exported symbols are prefixed by
   `lldpctl_`). No pollution of the global namespace.
 - Consistent return codes (on errors, all functions returning
   pointers are returning `NULL`, all functions returning integers are
   returning `-1`).
 - Reentrant and thread-safe. No global variables.
 - One well-documented [include file][].
 - Reduce the use of boilerplate code. Don't segfault on `NULL`,
   accept integer input as string, provide easy iterators, ...
 - Asynchronous API for input/output. The library delegates reading
   and writing by calling user-provided functions. Those functions can
   yield their effects. In this case, the user has to callback the
   library when data is available for reading or writing. It is
   therefore possible to integrate the library with any existing
   event-loop. A thin synchronous layer is provided on top of this
   API.
 - Opaque types with accessor functions.

[^library]: For more comprehensive guidelines, be sure to check
            [Writing a C library][].

Accessing bits of information is done through "atoms" which are opaque
containers of type `lldpctl_atom_t`. From an atom, you can extract
some properties as integers, strings, buffers or other atoms. The list
of ports is an atom. A port in this list is also an atom. The list of
VLAN present on this port is an atom, as well as each VLAN in this
list. The VLAN name is a `NULL`-terminated string living in the scope
of an atom. Accessing a property is done by a handful of functions,
like `lldpctl_atom_get_str()`, using a specific key. For example, here
is how to display the list of VLAN assuming you have one port as an
atom:

    ::c
    vlans = lldpctl_atom_get(port, lldpctl_k_port_vlans);
    lldpctl_atom_foreach(vlans, vlan) {
        vid = lldpctl_atom_get_int(vlan,
                                   lldpctl_k_vlan_id));
        name = lldpctl_atom_get_str(vlan,
                                    lldpctl_k_vlan_name));
        if (vid && name)
            printf("VLAN %d: %s\n", vid, name);
    }
    lldpctl_atom_dec_ref(vlans);

Internally, an atom is typed and reference counted. The size of the
API is greatly limited thanks to this concept. There are currently
more than one hundred pieces of information that can be retrieved from
`lldpd`.

Ultimately, the library will also enable the full configuration of
`lldpd`. Currently, many aspects can only be configured through
command-line flags. The use of the library does not replace
`lldpctl` which will still be available and be the primary client of
the library.

## CLI

Having a configuration file was requested since a long time. I didn't
want to include a parser in `lldpd`: I am trying to keep it small. It
was already possible to configure `lldpd` through
`lldpctl`. Locations, network policies and power policies were the
three items that could be configured this way. So, the next step was
to enable `lldpctl` to read a configuration file, parse it and send
the result to `lldpd`. As a bonus, why not provide a full CLI
accepting the same statements with inline help and completion?

### Parsing & completion

Because of completion, it is difficult to use a YACC generated
parser. Instead, I define a tree where each node accepts a word. A
node is defined with this function:

    ::c
    struct cmd_node *commands_new(
        struct cmd_node *,
        const char *,
        const char *,
        int(*validate)(struct cmd_env*, void *),
        int(*execute)(struct lldpctl_conn_t*, struct writer*,
            struct cmd_env*, void *),
        void *);

A node is defined by:

 - its parent,
 - an optional accepted static token,
 - an help string,
 - an optional validation function and
 - an optional function to execute if the current token is accepted.

When walking the tree, we maintain an environment which is both a
key-value store and a stack of positions in the tree. The validation
function can check the environment to see if we are in the right
context (we want to accept the keyword `foo` only once, for
example). The execution function can add the current token as a value
in the environment but it can also pop the current position in the
tree to resume walk from a previous node.

As an example, see how nodes for configuration of a coordinate-based
location are registered:

    ::c
    /* Our root node */
    struct cmd_node *configure_medloc_coord = commands_new(
        configure_medlocation,
        "coordinate", "MED location coordinate configuration",
        NULL, NULL, NULL);
    
    /* The exit node.
       The validate function will check if we have both
       latitude and longitude. */
    commands_new(configure_medloc_coord,
        NEWLINE, "Configure MED location coordinates",
        cmd_check_env, cmd_medlocation_coordinate,
        "latitude,longitude");
    
    /* Store latitude. Once stored, we pop two positions
       to go back to the "root" node. The user can only
       enter latitude once. */
    commands_new(
        commands_new(
            configure_medloc_coord,
            "latitude", "Specify latitude",
            cmd_check_no_env, NULL, "latitude"),
        NULL, "Latitude as xx.yyyyN or xx.yyyyS",
        NULL, cmd_store_env_value_and_pop2, "latitude");
    
    /* Same thing for longitude */
    commands_new(
        commands_new(
            configure_medloc_coord,
            "longitude", "Specify longitude",
            cmd_check_no_env, NULL, "longitude"),
        NULL, "Longitude as xx.yyyyE or xx.yyyyW",
        NULL, cmd_store_env_value_and_pop2, "longitude");

The definition of all commands is still a bit verbose but the system
is simple enough yet powerful enough to cover all needed cases.

### Readline

When faced with a CLI, we usually expect some perks like completion,
history handling and help. The most used library to provide such
features is the [GNU Readline Library][]. Because this is a GPL
library, I have first searched an alternative. There are several of
them:

 - [NetBSD Editline library][] (`libedit`).
 - [Autotool port of the NetBSD Editline library][] (also `libedit`).
 - [Debian version of the Editline library][] (`libeditline`).
 - [linenoise][], a small and minimal readline library.
 - Many others.

From an API point of view, the first three libraries support the _GNU
Readline_ API. They also have a common native API. Moreover, this
native API also handles tokenization. Therefore, I have developed the
first version of the CLI with this API[^libeditapi].

[^libeditapi]: Tokenization is not the only advantage of `libedit`
               native API. The API is also cleaner, does not have a
               global state and has a better documentation. All the
               implementations are also BSD licensed.

Unfortunately, I noticed later this library is not very common in the
Linux world and is not available in RHEL. Since I have used the native
API, it was not possible to fallback to the _GNU Readline_
library. So, let's switch! Thanks to the
[appropriate macro from the Autoconf Archive][ax_lib_readline] (with
small modifications), the compilation and linking differences between
the libraries are taken care of.

Because _GNU Readline_ library does not come with a tokenizer, I had
to write one myself. The API is also badly documented and it is
difficult to know which symbol is available in which version. I have
limited myself to:

 - `readline()`, `addhistory()`,
 - `rl_insert_text()`,
 - `rl_forced_update_display()`,
 - `rl_bind_key()`
 - `rl_line_buffer` and `rl_point`.

Unfortunately, the various `libedit` libraries have a noop for
`rl_bind_key()`. Therefore, completion and online help is not
available with them. I have noticed that most BSD come with _GNU
Readline_ library preinstalled, so it could be considered as a system
library. Nonetheless, linking with `libedit` to avoid licensing issues
is possible and help can be obtained by prefixing the command with
`help`.

# OS specific support

## Netlink on Linux

Previously, the list of interfaces was retrieved through
`getifaddrs()`. _lldpd_ is now using directly [Netlink][] on
Linux. This is not a big change since the _GNU C Library_ already uses
it to implement `getifaddrs()` and additional information, like VLAN,
are still retrieved through `ioctl()` or _sysfs_. However, _lldpd_
now gets notified when a change happens and update all interfaces in
the next second.

Like many other projects, I have written my own _Netlink_ implementation
instead of using [libnl][], a nice collection of libraries providing
everything you need to query the kernel through _Netlink_, including
some advanced bits. Why?

 1. The latest version of [libnl][] is still young and its
    availability in major distributions is scarce. It is not available
    in Debian Squeeze but will be available in Debian Wheezy. Like
    _libevent_, I could circumvent this problem by shipping the
    library with _lldpd_ and use it when there is not system
    alternative. But...

 2. _libnl_ is licensed under LGPL 2.1. This makes static linking
    difficult because the license is quite shaddy about static linking
    being derivative work or not. It is believed that it is authorized
    under the same provisions as in LGPL 3 which handles the case
    explicitely. This has been a problem with many projects. For
    example, [OGRE][] has added [an exception for static linking][] in
    version 1.6 and [switched to MIT license][] in version 1.7.

I had a short discussion with Thomas Graf about this issue and he
seems willing to add a similar exception. This may take some time, but
once this is done, I will happily switch to _libnl_ and retrieve more
stuff from _Netlink_.

## BSD support

Until version 0.7, _lldpd_ was Linux-only. The rewrite to use
_Netlink_ was the occasion to abstract interfaces and to port to other
OS. The first port was for [Debian GNU/kFreeBSD][], then for
[FreeBSD][], [OpenBSD][] and [NetBSD][]. They all share the same
source code:

 - `getifaddrs()` to get the list of interfaces,
 - `bpf(4)` to attach to an interface to receive and send packets,
 - `PF_ROUTE` socket to be notified when a change happens.

Each BSD has its own `ioctl()` to retrieve VLAN, bridging and bonding
bits but they are quite similar. The code was usually adapted from
`ifconfig.c`.

The BSD ports have the same functionalities than the Linux port,
except for _NetBSD_ which lacks support for LLDP-MED inventory since I
didn't find a simple way to retrieve DMI related information.

They also offer greater security by filtering packets sent. Moreover,
_OpenBSD_ allows to lock the filters set on the socket:

    ::c
    /* Install write filter (optional) */
    if (ioctl(fd, BIOCSETWF, (caddr_t)&fprog) < 0) {
        rc = errno;
        log_info("privsep", "unable to setup write BPF filter for %s",
            name);
        goto end;
    }
    
    /* Lock interface */
    if (ioctl(fd, BIOCLOCK, (caddr_t)&enable) < 0) {
        rc = errno;
        log_info("privsep", "unable to lock BPF interface %s",
            name);
        goto end;
    }

This is a very nice feature. _lldpd_ is using a privileged process to
open the raw socket. The socket is then transmitted to an unprivileged
process. Without this feature, the unprivileged process can remove the
BPF filters. I have ported the
[ability to lock a socket filter program][] to Linux. However, I still
have to add a write filter.

## OS X support

Once FreeBSD was supported, supporting OS X seemed easy. I got
sponsored by [xcloud.me][] which provided a virtual Mac server. Making
_lldpd_ work with OS X took only two days, including a full hour to
guess how to get Apple Xcode without providing a credit card.

To help people installing _lldpd_ on OS X, I have also written a
[_lldpd_ formula][] for [Homebrew][] which seems to be the most
popular package manager for OS X.

## Upstart and systemd support

Many distributions propose [upstart][] and [systemd][] as a
replacement or an alternative for the classic SysV init. Like most
daemons, _lldpd_ detaches itself from the terminal and run in the
background, by forking twice, once it is ready (for _lldpd_, this just
means we have setup the control socket). While both _upstart_ and
_systemd_ can accommodate daemons that behave like this, it is
recommended to not fork. How to advertise readiness in this case?

With _upstart_, _lldpd_ will send itself the `SIGSTOP`
signal. _upstart_ will detect this, resume _lldpd_ with `SIGCONT` and
assume it is ready. The code to support _upstart_ is therefore quite
simple. Instead of calling `daemon()`, do this:

    ::c
    const char *upstartjob = getenv("UPSTART_JOB");
    if (!(upstartjob && !strcmp(upstartjob, "lldpd")))
        return 0;
    log_debug("main", "running with upstart, don't fork but stop");
    raise(SIGSTOP);

The job configuration file looks like this:

    ::
    # lldpd - LLDP daemon

    description "LLDP daemon"

    start on net-device-up IFACE=lo
    stop on runlevel [06]

    expect stop
    respawn

    script
      . /etc/default/lldpd
      exec lldpd $DAEMON_ARGS
    end script

_systemd_ provides a socket to achieve the same goal. An application
is expected to write `READY=1` to the socket when it is ready. With
the provided library, this is just a matter of calling
`sd_notify("READY=1\n")`. Since `sd_notify()` has less than 30 lines
of code, I have rewritten it to avoid an external dependency. The
appropriate unit file is:

    ::ini
    [Unit]
    Description=LLDP daemon
    Documentation=man:lldpd(8)

    [Service]
    Type=notify
    NotifyAccess=main
    EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/lldpd
    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/lldpd $DAEMON_ARGS
    Restart=on-failure

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

## OS include files

Linux-specific include files were a major pain in previous versions of
_lldpd_. The problems range from missing header files (like
`linux/if_bonding.h`) to the use of kernel-only types. Those headers
have a difficult history. They were first shipped with the C library
but were rarely synced and almost always outdated. They were then
extracted from kernel version with almost no change and lagged behind
the kernel version used by the released distribution[^sarge].

[^sarge]: For example, in Debian Sarge, the Linux kernel was a 2.6.8
          (2004) while the kernel headers were extracted from some
          pre-2.6 kernel.

Today, the problem is acknowledged and is being solved by both the
distributions which extract the headers from the packaged kernel and
by kernel developers with a
[separation of kernel-only headers from user-space API headers][]. However,
we still need to handle legacy.

A good case is `linux/ethtool.h`:

 - It can just be absent.
 - It can use `u8`, `u16` types which are kernel-only types. To work
   around this issue, [type munging][] can be setup.
 - It can miss some definition, like `SPEED_10000`. In this case, you
   either define the missing bits and find yourself with a long copy
   of the original header interleaved with `#ifdef` or conditionally
   use each symbol. The latest solution is a burden by itself but it
   also hinders some functionalities that can be available in the
   running kernel.

The easy solution to all this mess is to just include the appropriate
kernel headers into the source tree of the project. Thanks to Google
ripping them for its Bionic C library, we know that
[copying kernel headers into a program does not create a derivative work][].
