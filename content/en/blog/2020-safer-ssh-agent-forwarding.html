title: "Safer SSH agent forwarding"
description: |
  Using SSH agent forwarding is dangerous. However, a dedicated
  agent can mitigate the risks.

`ssh-agent` is a program to hold in memory the private keys used by
SSH for public-key authentication. When the agent is running, `ssh`
forwards to it the signature requests from the server. The agent
performs the private key operations and returns the results to `ssh`.
It is useful if you keep your private keys encrypted on disk and you
don't want to type the password at each connection. Keeping the agent
secure is critical: someone able to communicate with the agent can
authenticate on your behalf on remote servers.

`ssh` also provides the ability to *forward the agent* to a remote
server. From this remote server, you can authenticate to another
server using your local agent, without copying your private key on the
intermediate server. As stated in the [manual page][ssh-A], this is
dangerous!

As mentioned, a better alternative is to use the *jump host* feature:
the SSH connection to the target host is tunneled through the SSH
connection to the jump host. See the [manual page][ssh-J] and this
[blog post][jump host] for more details.

If you *really* need to use SSH agent forwarding, you can secure it a
bit through a dedicated agent with two main attributes:

 - it holds only the private key to connect to the target host, and
 - it asks confirmation for each requested signature.

The following alias around the `ssh` command will spawn such an
ephemeral agent:

    ::sh
    alias assh="ssh-agent ssh -o AddKeysToAgent=confirm -o ForwardAgent=yes"

With the `-o AddKeysToAgent=confirm` directive, `ssh` adds the
unencrypted private key to the agent but each use must be
confirmed.[^ssh-add] Once connected, you get a password prompt for
each signature request:[^confirm]

![ssh-agent prompt confirmation with fingerprint and yes/no buttons]([[!!images/ssh-agent-prompt@2x.png]]
"Request for the agent to use the specified private key")

[^ssh-add]: Alternatively, you can add the keys with `ssh-add -c`.
[^confirm]: Unfortunately, the dialog box default answer is "Yes."

But, again, avoid using agent forwarding! ☠️

!!! "Update (2020-04)" In a [previous version][] of this article, the
wrapper around the `ssh` command was a more complex function.
[Alexandre Oliva][] was kind enough to point me to the simpler
solution above.

!!! "Update (2020-04)" [Guardian Agent][] is an even safer
alternative: it shows and ensures the usage (target and command) of
the requested signature. There is also a wide range of alternative
solutions to this problem. See for example [SSH-Ident][], [Wikimedia
solution][] and [solo-agent][].
