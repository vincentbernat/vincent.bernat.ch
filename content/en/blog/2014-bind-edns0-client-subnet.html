To provide **geolocation-aware answers** with [BIND][], a common
solution is to use a [patch adding GeoIP support][geoip]. A client can
be directed to the closest (and hopefully fastest) web server:

    ::text
    view "FRANCE" {
         match-clients { geoip_cityDB_country_FR; };
         zone "example.com" in {
             type master;
             file "france.example.com.dns";
         };
    };
    view "GERMANY" {
         match-clients { geoip_cityDB_country_DE; };
         zone "example.com" in {
             type master;
             file "germany.example.com.dns";
         };
    };
    /* [...] */
    view "DEFAULT" {
        zone "example.com" in {
            type master;
            file "example.com.dns";
        };
    };

However, an end user does not usually talk directly to authoritative
servers. They proxy the query to a **third-party recursor server**
which will query the authoritative server on their behalf. The
recursor also caches the answer to be able to serve it directly to
other clients.

On most cases, we can still rely on the recursor GeoIP location to
forward the client to the closest web server because it is located in
the client's ISP network, as shown on the following schema:

![Query for www.example.com through an ISP recursor][1]
[1]: [[!!images/dns-isp-recursor.png]] "Ideal case: the recursor is located close to the end user."

 1. Juan is located in China and wants to know the IP address of
    `www.example.com`. She queries her ISP resolver.
 2. The resolver asks the authoritative server for the answer.
 3. Because the IP address of the **resolver** is located in China, the
    authoritative server decides to answer with the IP address of the
    web server located in Japan which is the closest one.
 4. Juan can now enjoy short round-trips with the web server.

However, this is not the case when using a public recursor as provided
by [Google][] or [OpenDNS][]. In this case, the IP address of the end
client and the source IP address of the recursor may not share the same
locality. For example, in the following schema, the authoritative
server now thinks it is in relation with an European customer and
answers with the IP address of the web server located in Europe:

![Query for www.example.com through an open recursor][2]
[2]: [[!!images/dns-open-recursor.png]] "Worst case: the recursor queries the authoritative server through a remote node."

Moreover, **caching makes the problem worse**.

To solve this problem, a new
[EDNS extension to expose the client subnet][] has been proposed. When
using this extension, the recursor will provide the client subnet to
the authoritative server for it to build an optimized reply. The
subnet is vague enough to respect client's privacy but precise enough
to be able to locate it. A [patched version of `dig`][dig] allows one
to make queries with this new extension:

    ::console
    $ geoiplookup 138.231.136.0
    GeoIP Country Edition: FR, France
    $ ./bin/dig/dig @dns-02.dailymotion.com www.dailymotion.com \

    $ geoiplookup 195.8.215.136
    GeoIP Country Edition: FR, France

In the above example, a client located in France gets a reply with two IP
addresses located in France. If we now are an US client, we will get
IP addresses located in the US:

    ::console
    $ geoiplookup 170.149.100.0
    GeoIP Country Edition: US, United States
    $ ./bin/dig/dig @dns-02.dailymotion.com www.dailymotion.com \

The recursor is expected to cache the two different answers and only
serve them if the client matches the appropriate subnet (the one
confirmed in the answer from the authoritative server). With this new
extension, the authoritative server knows that Juan is located in
China and answers with the appropriate IP address:

![Query for www.example.com through an open recursor with client subnet][3]
[3]: [[!!images/dns-open-recursor-with-edns.png]] "Corrected case: the recursor queries the authoritative server through a remote node but provides the client subnet."

Not many authoritative servers support this extension ([PowerDNS][]
and [gdnsd][], as far as I know). At [Dailymotion][], we have built a
[patch for _BIND_][subnet-bind]. It only works when _BIND_ is
configured as an authoritative server and it doesn't expose no
configuration knobs. Feel free to use it (at your own risk). Once
installed, you need to register yourself to [OpenDNS][rOpenDNS] and to
[Google][rGoogle] to receive queries with the extension enabled.
