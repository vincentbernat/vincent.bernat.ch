Distributing software efficiently across your platform can be
difficult. Every distribution comes with a package manager which is
usually suited for this task. APT can be relied upon when using
[Debian][] or a derivative.

Unfortunately, the official repositories may not contain everything
you need. When you require unpackaged software or more recent versions,
it is possible to set up your own local repository.

Most of what is presented here were set up for [Dailymotion][] and was
greatly inspired by the work done by [Raphaël Pinson][] at Orange.

[TOC]

# Setting up your repositories

There are three kinds of repositories you may want to set up:

 1. A **distribution mirror**. Such a mirror will save bandwidth,
    provide faster downloads and permanent access, even when someone
    [types Google into Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2FMqtC1x9Y).

 2. A **local repository** for your own packages with the ability to
    have a staging zone to test packages on some servers before
    putting them in production.

 3. Mirrors for **unofficial repositories**, like [Ubuntu PPA][]. To
    avoid unexpected changes, such a repository will also get a
    staging and a production zone.

Before going further, it is quite important to understand what a
repository is. Let's illustrate with the following line from my
`/etc/apt/sources.list`:

    ::sources.list
    deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free

In this example, `http://ftp.debian.org/debian/` is the **repository**
and `unstable` is the **distribution**. A distribution is subdivided
into **components**. We have three components: `main`, `contrib`, and
`non-free`.

To set up repositories, we will use [reprepro][]. This is not the only
solution but it has a good balance between versatility and
simplicity. _reprepro_ can only handle one repository. The first
choice is about how you will split your packages into repositories,
distributions, and components.

!!! "Update (2019-06)" [aptly][] is an alternative to *reprepro*. It
handles multiple repositories. It features an HTTP API. It can keep
older versions of a package. To mirror complete distributions,
*reprepro* is more performant but for everything else, I advise you to
use *aptly*.

Here is what matters:

 - A **repository** cannot contain two identical packages (same name,
   version, and architecture).
 - Inside a **component**, you can only have one version of a package.
 - Usually, a **distribution is a subset of the versions** while a
   **component is a subset of the packages**. For example, in Debian,
   with the distribution `unstable`, you choose to get the most recent
   versions while with the component `main`, you choose to get DFSG-free
   software only.

If you go for several repositories, you will have to handle several
_reprepro_ instances and won't be able to easily copy packages from
one place to another. At [Dailymotion][], we put everything in the
same repository but it would also be perfectly valid to have three repositories:

 - one to mirror the distribution,
 - one for your local packages, and
 - one to mirror unofficial repositories.

Here is our target setup:

![Local APT repository][2]
[2]: [[!!images/apt-repository.svg]] "A repository with three distributions, including a staging area."

## Initial setup

First, create a system user to work with the repositories:

    ::console
    $ adduser --system --disabled-password --disabled-login \
              --home /srv/packages \
              --group reprepro

All operations should be done with this user only. If you want to
set up several repositories, create a directory for each of
them. Each repository has these subdirectories:

 - `conf/` contains the configuration files,
 - `gpg/` contains the GPG stuff to sign the repository,[^sharegpg]
 - `logs/` contains the logs,
 - `www/` contains the repository that should be exported by the web server.

[^sharegpg]: The `gpg/` directory could be shared by several repositories.

Here is the content of `conf/options`:

    outdir +b/www
    logdir +b/logs
    gnupghome +b/gpg

Then, you need to create the GPG key to sign the repository:

    ::console
    $ GNUPGHOME=gpg gpg --gen-key
    Please select what kind of key you want:
       (1) RSA and RSA (default)
       (2) DSA and Elgamal
       (3) DSA (sign only)
       (4) RSA (sign only)
    Your selection? 1
    RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
    What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
    Requested keysize is 4096 bits
    Please specify how long the key should be valid.
             0 = key does not expire
          <n>  = key expires in n days
          <n>w = key expires in n weeks
          <n>m = key expires in n months
          <n>y = key expires in n years
    Key is valid for? (0) 10y
    Key expires at mer. 08 nov. 2023 22:30:58 CET
    Is this correct? (y/N) y

By setting an empty password, you allow _reprepro_ to run unattended.
You will have to distribute the public key of your new repository to
let APT check the archive signature. An easy way is to ship it in some
package.

## Local mirror of an official distribution

Let's start by mirroring a distribution. We want a local mirror of
Ubuntu Precise. For this, we need to do two things:

 1. Setup a new **distribution** in `conf/distributions`.
 2. Configure the **update sources** in `conf/updates`.

Let's add this block to `conf/distributions`:

    ::ini
    # Ubuntu Precise
    Origin: Ubuntu
    Label: Ubuntu
    Suite: precise
    Version: 12.04
    Codename: precise
    Architectures: i386 amd64
    Components: main restricted universe multiverse
    UDebComponents: main restricted universe multiverse
    Description: Ubuntu Precise 12.04 (with updates and security)
    Contents: .gz .bz2
    UDebIndices: Packages Release . .gz
    Tracking: minimal
    Update: - ubuntu-precise ubuntu-precise-updates ubuntu-precise-security
    SignWith: yes

This defines the `precise` distribution in our repository. It contains
four components: `main`, `restricted`, `universe`, and `multiverse`
(like the regular distribution in official repositories).

The `Update` line starts with a dash. This means _reprepro_ will
mark everything as deleted before updating with the provided
sources. Old packages will not be kept when they are removed from
Ubuntu. In `conf/updates`, we define the sources:

    ::ini
    # Ubuntu Precise
    Name: ubuntu-precise
    Method: http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
    Fallback: http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
    Suite: precise
    Components: main multiverse restricted universe
    UDebComponents: main restricted universe multiverse
    Architectures: amd64 i386
    VerifyRelease: 437D05B5
    GetInRelease: no
    
    # Ubuntu Precise Updates
    Name: ubuntu-precise-updates
    Method: http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
    Fallback: http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
    Suite: precise-updates
    Components: main restricted universe multiverse
    UDebComponents: main restricted universe multiverse
    Architectures: amd64 i386
    VerifyRelease: 437D05B5
    GetInRelease: no
    
    # Ubuntu Precise Security
    Name: ubuntu-precise-security
    Method: http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
    Fallback: http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
    Suite: precise-security
    Components: main restricted universe multiverse
    UDebComponents: main restricted universe multiverse
    Architectures: amd64 i386
    VerifyRelease: 437D05B5
    GetInRelease: no

The `VerifyRelease` lines are GPG key fingerprint to use to check the
remote repository. The key needs to be imported in the local keyring:

    ::console
    $ gpg --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg \
          --export 437D05B5 | GNUPGHOME=gpg gpg --import

Another important point is that we merge three distributions
(`precise`, `precise-updates` and `precise-security`) into a single
distribution (`precise`) in our local repository. This may cause some
difficulties with tools expecting the three distributions to be
available (like the Debian Installer[^installer]).

[^installer]: We taught Debian Installer to work with our setup with
              an [appropriate preseed file][preseed].
               
Next, you can run _reprepro_ and ask it to update your local mirror:

    ::console
    $ reprepro update

This will take some time on the first run. You can execute this
command every night. _reprepro_ is not the fastest mirror solution but
it is easy to setup, flexible, and reliable.

## Repository for local packages

Let's configure the repository to accept local packages. For each
official distribution (like `precise`), we will configure two
distributions:

 * `precise-staging` contains packages that have not been fully
   tested and not ready to go to production.
 * `precise-prod` contains production packages copied from
   `precise-staging`.

In our workflow, packages are introduced in `precise-staging` where
they can be tested and will be copied to `precise-prod` when we want
them to be available for production. You can adopt a more complex
workflow if you need it. The _reprepro_ part is quite easy. We add the
following blocks into `conf/distributions`:

    ::ini
    # Dailymotion Precise packages (staging)
    Origin: Dailymotion # ❸
    Label: dm-staging   # ❸
    Suite: precise-staging
    Codename: precise-staging
    Architectures: i386 amd64 source
    Components: main role/dns role/database role/web # ❶
    Description: Dailymotion Precise staging repository
    Contents: .gz .bz2
    Tracking: keep
    SignWith: yes
    NotAutomatic: yes # ❷
    Log: packages.dm-precise-staging.log
     --type=dsc email-changes
    
    # Dailymotion Precise packages (prod)
    Origin: Dailymotion # ❸
    Label: dm-prod      # ❸
    Suite: precise-prod
    Codename: precise-prod
    Architectures: i386 amd64 source
    Components: main role/dns role/database role/web # ❶
    Description: Dailymotion Precise prod repository
    Contents: .gz .bz2
    Tracking: keep
    SignWith: yes
    Log: packages.dm-precise-prod.log

First notice we use several components (in ❶):

 * `main` will contain packages that are not specific to a subset of
   the platform. If you put a package in `main`, it should work
   correctly on any host.
 * `role/*` are components dedicated to a subset of the platform. For
   example, in `role/dns`, we ship a custom version of _BIND_.

The staging distribution has the `NotAutomatic` flag (in ❷) which
disallows the package manager to install these packages except if the
user explicitly requests it. Just below, when a new `dsc` file is
uploaded, the hook [`email-changes`][email-changes] will be
executed. It should be in the `conf/` directory.

The `Origin` and `Label` lines (in ❸) are quite important to be able
to define an explicit policy of which packages should be
installed. Let's say we use the following `/etc/apt/sources.list`
file:

    ::sources.list
    # Ubuntu packages
    deb http://packages.dm.gg/dailymotion precise main restricted universe multiverse
    
    # Dailymotion packages
    deb http://packages.dm.gg/dailymotion precise-prod    main role/dns
    deb http://packages.dm.gg/dailymotion precise-staging main role/dns

All servers have the `precise-staging` distribution. We must ensure
we won't install these packages by mistake. The `NotAutomatic`
flag is one possible safe-guard. We also use a tailored
`/etc/apt/preferences`:

    Explanation: Dailymotion packages of a specific component should be more preferred
    Package: *
    Pin: release o=Dailymotion, l=dm-prod, c=role/*
    Pin-Priority: 950
    
    Explanation: Dailymotion packages should be preferred
    Package: *
    Pin: release o=Dailymotion, l=dm-prod
    Pin-Priority: 900
    
    Explanation: staging should never be preferred
    Package: *
    Pin: release o=Dailymotion, l=dm-staging
    Pin-Priority: -100

By default, packages will have a priority of 500. By setting a
priority of -100 to the staging distribution, we ensure the packages
cannot be installed at all. This is stronger than `NotAutomatic` which
sets the priority to 1. When a package exists in Ubuntu and our local
repository, we ensure that, if this is a production package, we will
use ours by using a priority of 900 (or 950 if we match a specific
role component).

Have a look at the "_How APT Interprets Priorities_" section of
[`apt_preferences(5)`][apt_preferences] manual page for additional
information. Keep in mind that version matters only when the priority
is the same. To check if everything works as you expect, use
`apt-cache policy`:

    ::console
    $ apt-cache policy php5-memcache
      Installed: 3.0.8-1~precise2~dm1
      Candidate: 3.0.8-1~precise2~dm1
      Version table:
     *** 3.0.8-1~precise2~dm1 0
            950 http://packages.dm.gg/dailymotion/ precise-prod/role/web amd64 Packages
            100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
         3.0.8-1~precise1~dm4 0
            900 http://packages.dm.gg/dailymotion/ precise-prod/main amd64 Packages
           -100 http://packages.dm.gg/dailymotion/ precise-staging/main amd64 Packages
         3.0.6-1 0
            500 http://packages.dm.gg/dailymotion/ precise/universe amd64 Packages

If we want to install a package from the staging distribution, we can
use `apt-get` with the `-t precise-staging` option to raise the
priority of this distribution to 990.

Once you have tested your package, you can copy it from the staging
distribution to the production distribution:

    ::console
    $ reprepro -C main copysrc precise-prod precise-staging wackadoodle

## Local mirror of third-party repositories

Sometimes, you want a piece of software published on some third-party
repository without repackaging it yourself. A common example is the
repositories edited by hardware vendors. As for an Ubuntu mirror,
there are two steps: defining the distribution and defining the
source.

We chose to put such mirrors into the same distributions as our local
packages but with a dedicated component for each mirror. This way,
these third-party packages will share the same workflow as our local
packages: they will appear in the staging distribution, we validate
them and copy them to the production distribution.

The first step is to add the components and an appropriate `Update`
line to `conf/distributions`:

    ::ini
    Origin: Dailymotion
    Label: dm-staging
    Suite: precise-staging
    Components: main role/dns role/database role/web vendor/hp
    Update: hp
    # [...]
    
    Origin: Dailymotion
    Label: dm-prod
    Suite: precise-prod
    Components: main role/dns role/database role/web vendor/hp
    # [...]

We added the `vendor/hp` component to both the staging and the
production distributions. However, only the staging distribution gets
an `Update` line (remember, packages will be copied manually into the
production distribution).

We declare the source in `conf/updates`:

    ::ini
    # HP repository
    Name: hp
    Method: http://downloads.linux.hp.com/SDR/downloads/ManagementComponentPack/
    Suite: precise/current
    Components: non-free>vendor/hp
    Architectures: i386 amd64
    VerifyRelease: 2689B887
    GetInRelease: no

Don't forget to add the GPG key to your local keyring. Notice an
interesting feature of _reprepro_: we copy the remote `non-free`
component to our local `vendor/hp` component.

Then, you can synchronize the mirror with `reprepro update`. Once the
packages have been tested, you will have to copy them in the
production distribution.

# Building Debian packages

Our _reprepro_ setup seems complete, but how do we put packages into
the staging distribution?

You have several options to build Debian packages for your local
repository. It depends on how much time you want to invest in this
activity:

 1. Build packages **from source** by adding a `debian/`
    directory. This is the classic way of building Debian
    packages. You can start from scratch or use an existing package as
    a base. In the latest case, the package can be from the official
    archive but for a more recent distribution or a backport or from
    an unofficial repository.

 2. Use a **tool that will create a binary package from a directory**,
    like [fpm][]. Such a tool will try to guess a lot of things to
    minimize your work. It can even download everything for you.

There is no universal solution. If you don't have the time budget for
building packages from source, have a look at [fpm][]. I would advise
you to use the first approach when possible because you will get these
perks for free:

 * You **keep the sources** in your repository. Whenever you need to
   rebuild something to fix an emergency bug, you won't have to hunt
   the sources which may be unavailable when you need them the
   most. This only works if you build packages that don't download
   stuff directly from the Internet.

 * You also **keep the recipe**[^recipe] to build the package in your
   repository. If someone enables some option and rebuild the package,
   you won't accidentally drop this option on the next build. These
   changes can be documented in `debian/changelog`. Moreover, you can
   use a version control software for the whole `debian/` directory.

 * You can propose your package for **inclusion into Debian**. This
   will help many people once the package hits the archive.

!!! "Update (2017-10)" I present an alternate approach to create
Debian packages without much effort in “[Pragmatic Debian
packaging][].”

[^recipe]: [fpm-cookery][] is a convenient tool to write recipes
           for [fpm][], similar to [Homebrew][] or a BSD port
           tree. It could be used to achieve the same goal.

## Builders

We chose [pbuilder][] as a builder.[^vssbuild] Its setup is quite
straightforward. Here is our `/etc/pbuilderrc`:

    ::bash
    DISTRIBUTION=$DIST
    NAME="$DIST-$ARCH"
    MIRRORSITE=http://packages.dm.gg/dailymotion
    COMPONENTS=("main" "restricted" "universe" "multiverse")
    OTHERMIRROR="deb http://packages.dm.gg/dailymotion ${DIST}-staging main"
    HOOKDIR=/etc/pbuilder/hooks.d
    BASE=/var/cache/pbuilder/dailymotion
    BASETGZ=$BASE/$NAME/base.tgz
    BUILDRESULT=$BASE/$NAME/results/
    APTCACHE=$BASE/$NAME/aptcache/
    DEBBUILDOPTS="-sa"
    KEYRING="/usr/share/keyrings/dailymotion-archive.keyring.gpg"
    DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS=("--arch" "$ARCH" "--variant=buildd" "${DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS[@]}" "--keyring=$KEYRING")
    APTKEYRINGS=("$KEYRING")
    EXTRAPACKAGES=("dailymotion-archive-keyring")

[^vssbuild]: [sbuild][] is an alternative to _pbuilder_ and is the
             official builder for both Debian and
             Ubuntu. Historically, _pbuilder_ was more focused on
             developers' needs.

`pbuilder` is expected to be invoked with `DIST`, `ARCH` and
optionally `ROLE` environment variables. Building the initial bases
can be done like this:

    ::bash
    for ARCH in i386 amd64; do
      for DIST in precise; do
        export ARCH
        export DIST
        pbuilder --create
      done
    done

We don't create a base for each role. Instead, we use a `D` hook to
add the appropriate source:

    ::bash
    #!/bin/bash
    [ -z "$ROLE" ] || {
      cat >> /etc/apt/sources.list <<EOF
    deb http://packages.dm.gg/dailymotion ${DIST}-staging role/${ROLE}
    EOF
    }
    
    apt-get update

We ensure packages from our staging distribution are preferred
over other packages by adding an `/etc/apt/preferences` file
in an `E` hook:

    ::bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    cat > /etc/apt/preferences <<EOF
    Explanation: Dailymotion packages are of higher priority
    Package: *
    Pin: release o=Dailymotion
    Pin-Priority: 900
    EOF

We also use a `C` hook to get a shell in case there is an error. This
is convenient to debug a problem:

    ::bash
    #!/bin/bash
    apt-get install -y --force-yes vim less
    cd /tmp/buildd/*/debian/..
    /bin/bash < /dev/tty > /dev/tty 2> /dev/tty

A manual build can be run with:

    ::console
    $ ARCH=amd64 DIST=precise ROLE=web pbuilder \
              --build somepackage.dsc

## Version numbering

To avoid applying complex rules to chose a version number for a package,
we chose to treat everything as a backport, even in-house software. We
use the following scheme: `X-Y~preciseZ+dmW`.

 * `X` is the upstream version.[^snapshot]

 * `Y` is the Debian version. If there is no Debian version, use 0.

 * `Z` is the Ubuntu backport version. Again, if such a version
   doesn't exist, use 0.

 * `W` is our version of the package. We increment it when we make a
   change to the packaging. This is the only number we are
   allowed to control. All the others are set by an upstream entity
   unless it doesn't exist and, in this case, you use 0.

[^snapshot]: For a Git snapshot, we use something like `1.4-git20130905+1-ae42dc1` which is a snapshot made
             after version 1.4 (use 0.0 if no version has ever been
             released) at the given date. The following 1 is to be
             able to package different snapshots on the same date
             while the hash is here in case you need to retrieve
             the exact snapshot.
   
Let's suppose you need to backport `wackadoodle`. It is available in a
more recent version of Ubuntu as `1.4-3`. Your first backport will be
`1.4-3~precise0+dm1`. After a change to the packaging, the version
will be `1.4-3~precise0+dm2`. A new upstream version `1.5`
is available and you need it. You will use `1.5-0~precise0+dm1`.

Later, this new upstream version will be available in some version of
Ubuntu as `1.5-3ubuntu1`. You will rebase your changes on this version
and get `1.5-3ubuntu1~precise0+dm1`.

When using Debian instead of Ubuntu, a compatible convention could
be: `X-Y~bpo70+Z~dm+W`.

## Uploading

To upload a package, a common setup is the following workflow:

 1. Upload the source package to an incoming directory.
 2. _reprepro_ will notice the _source_ package, check its
    correctness (signature, distribution), and put it in the archive.
 3. The builder will notice a new package needs to be built and
    build it.
 4. Once the package is built, the builder will upload the result to
    the incoming directory.
 5. _reprepro_ will notice again the new _binary_ package and
    integrate it into the archive.

This workflow has the disadvantage to have many moving pieces and to
leave the user in the dark while the compilation is in
progress. Instead, a build script is used to execute each step
synchronously. The user can follow on their terminal that everything
works as expected. The build script also handles uploading the final
packages to the archive with the appropriate command:

    ::console
    $ reprepro -C main include precise-staging \
           wackadoodle_1.4-3~precise0+dm4_amd64.changes

Happy hacking!
