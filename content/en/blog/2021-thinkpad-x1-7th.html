  Two years ago, I switched from the second to the seventh generation of
  the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. Here is my feedback.

Two years ago, I replaced [my ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2014][] with the
latest generation. The new configuration embeds an Intel Core
i7-8565U, 16Â Gib of RAM, a 1Â Tib NVMe disk, and a WQHD display
(2560Ã—1440). I did not ask for a WWAN card. I think it is easier and
more reliable to use the wifi hotspot feature of a phone instead: no
unreliable firmware and unsupported drivers.[^fibocom] Here is my
opinion on this model.

[^fibocom]: The seventh generation moved from Sierra Wireless to
    Fibocom. While Linux support for modems is good, thanks to
    [ModemManager][], they are usually driven over the USB bus. The
    Fibocom L850-GL can use either the USB bus or the PCI bus but
    Lenovo's BIOS blacklists the former. It took quite some time to
    find how to [switch it to USB][] after booting. A [PCI driver is
    in progress][].

While the second generation got a very odd **keyboard**, this one got
a classic one with a full row of function keys. I don't know if my
model was defective, but the keyboard skips one keypress from time to
time. I have got used to it, but the space key still has a hard time
registering when hitting it with my right thumb. The travel course is
also shorter and it is less comfortable to type on it than it was on
the 2014 version. The trackpoint[^trackpoint] works well. The physical
buttons are a welcome addition. I am only using the trackpad for
scrolling with the two-finger gesture.

Gen]([[!!images/x1c-7th/keyboard@2x.jpg]] "Keyboard with an ANSI QWERTY
layout (aka English EU for Lenovo). The LEDs on the speaker and
microphone keys work out of the box on Linux.")

[^trackpoint]: I did replace the trackpoint with a low-profile one from
    [SaotoTech][].

The **screen** does not suffer from ghosting effects like the one in
my previous ThinkPad. To avoid leaving marks on the screen, I use a
[piece of cloth][] on top of the keyboard when closing the laptop. The
720p **webcam** has a built-in mechanical cover. Its quality is not
great, but it does the job.

**Battery life** effortlessly reaches about 8 hours on a full charge.
This is the main reason this laptop feels like a solid upgrade
compared to the previous one: no need to carry a power brick during
the day.

This is the first Lenovo model with a **sound card** requiring the
[Sound Open Firmware][]. Without the appropriate firmware and the
related userspace components (ALSA UCM and PulseAudio), the microphone
does not work. If everything is set up correctly, the speakers produce
a very decent sound, better than the 2014 model. It should now work
out-of-the-box with Debian Bullseye. Just install the
`sof-firmware-signed` package.

The **BIOS** can be updated directly from Linux, thanks to the [Linux
Vendor Firmware Service][].

I was using the [ThinkPad USB-C Dock Gen 2][] as a **docking
station**. Everything works out-of-the-box. However, from time to
time, I got issues reliably getting an image on the two screens. I was
using a couple of 10-year LG monitors with DVI connectors, so I relied
on DPâ†’HDMIâ†’DVI adapters. This may have been the source of some of the
problems.

In summary, this is a fine laptop plagued with a bad keyboard. I did
appreciate the good battery life and the fact there is still one HDMI
and two USB-A ports, so I didn't need to travel with dongles. I was
disappointed by how small the performance gap was with my 5-year older
laptop. I am unsure to get a Lenovo for the next one: HiDPI screens
are mostly unavailable and current prices are high. Other
possibilities include:

 - [Lenovo ThinkPad P14s][] with an AMD Ryzen CPUâ€”currently unavailable with a HiDPI screen,
 - [Dell XPS 13][]â€”no USB-A, no HDMI port, or
 - [HP Spectre x360 14][]â€”no HDMI port.

Until then, I am using my previous ThinkPad. ðŸ”Œ
