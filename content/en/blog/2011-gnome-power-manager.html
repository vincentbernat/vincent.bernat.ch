When I installed my [new laptop][thinkpad], I decided to switch from
[sleepd][sleepd] to [GNOME Power Manager][gpm] (*GPM*). The rationale
behind this decision was to get screen dimming for free while keeping
other features because *GPM* uses [*UPower*][upower] which uses
`pm-suspend` and `pm-powersave` behind the scene. This means that it
is easy to execute scripts on suspend or when the AC is unplugged by
putting them in `/etc/pm`.

I don't use a full GNOME desktop. My desktop is running [FVWM][fvwm]
which is just a window manager. However, I already use some parts of
the GNOME environment:

* GDM as a display manager because it is the only one that is able to
  handle *ConsoleKit* correctly. This means that GDM is able to register
  your session to *ConsoleKit* **and** make it active. Without that, you
  won't be considered as the user sitting in front of the screen and
  DBus won't allow you to interact with most of your hardware unless
  you add yourself to a lot of groups. *ConsoleKit* enables the
  `at_console` property used by most policies.
* Network Manager to handle both wired and wireless
  connections. Connecting to some random AP using only command line
  tools is rather cumbersome (assume that the AP is using
  WPA). Connecting to a broadband network with a 3G dongle is even
  more cumbersome.
* GNOME bluetooth applet because interacting with BlueZ bluetooth
  stack is now done with DBus only and the command line tools have
  been removed. Therefore, you need to write your own tools or use
  this small applet that do most of the work for you.

# What's working

It happens that most of the features just do not work. However,
suspend when closing the lid works fine. The icon in the systray works
fine too (but there is a small bug). The screen dimming feature on idle
also works (but there are annoying bugs with it). The visual feedback when
pressing brightness keys works too.

# What's not working

It seems that I am not the only one to have problem with *GPM*: there
are currently [115 bugs opened in the Debian BTS][bugs]. If you want
to get some debug output from `gnome-power-manager`, run it with
`--verbose` flag. `--debug` flag does nothing (and supersedes
`--verbose`).

## Nothing happens when pressing the power button

I have configured *GPM* to ask me what to do when I press the power
button. But when I press the button, nothing happens. Looking at the
source, here is the snippet of code that is executed:

    ::c
    if (policy == GPM_ACTION_POLICY_INTERACTIVE) {
        GpmSession *session;
        egg_debug ("logout, reason: %s", reason);
        session = gpm_session_new ();
        gpm_session_logout (session);
        g_object_unref (session);
    }

In fact, this is not *GPM* that will ask you the question, but GNOME
session manager because *GPM* triggers logout. If you don't run a full
GNOME session, nothing will happen.

My workaround is just to set the action to "Suspend".

## Does not sleep when idle

*GPM* is configured to go to sleep after 2 hours on AC or 30 minutes on
battery. This does not work for me because idle detection is delegated
to external programs. There are four variables used by *GPM*
to determine if we are idle:

 * `session_idle` which is the idle hint from *ConsoleKit*,
 * `idle_inhibited` which is set when another program asks to disable
   idle detection (a video player which does not want the screen to be
   dimmed),
 * `suspend_inhibited` which means a program do not want we going to
   sleep (a music player for example)
 * `x_idle` which tells if X is idle or not (someone is moving the
   mouse or typing on the keyboard).

To allow *GPM* to suspend when we are idle, `x_idle` and `session_idle`
must be true while `suspend_inhibited` and `idle_inhibited` must be
false. For screen dimming purpose, you just need to have `x_idle` set
to true and `idle_inhibited` set to false.

Currently, only *GNOME Screensaver* seems to tell *ConsoleKit* if the
session is idle or not. *XScreenSaver* does not contain anything about
this. I am using `xautolock` with `xlock` and I am pretty sure they
won't tell *GPM* if I am idle.

You can use `dbus-send` to circumvent this problem:

    ::console
    $ dbus-send --system --dest=org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit \
    >   --type=method_call --print-reply --reply-timeout=2000 \
    >   /org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Manager \
    >   org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Manager.GetCurrentSession
    method return sender=:1.6 -> dest=:1.106 reply_serial=2
       object path "/org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Session1"
    $ dbus-send --system --dest=org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit \
    >   --type=method_call --print-reply --reply-timeout=2000 \
    >   /org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Session1 \
    >   org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Session.SetIdleHint boolean:true          
    method return sender=:1.6 -> dest=:1.108 reply_serial=2

While I understand what is the rationale behind those choices (no code
duplicate and allowing external programs to hinder power management),
it lacks some fallback in case you don't use *GNOME Screensaver* (which
is the key component here).

I first though this was [bug #594706][594706] but this is not the
case. I have opened (and closed) [bug #628755][628755].

**UPDATED:** Jump to the conclusion for an updated solution for this
problem.

## Brightness is not restored to the previous value after idle

When *GPM* undims the screen, it does not restore the previous value. It
seems to be [bug #617310][617310] which is marked as fixed in
upstream. I did not investigate it.

## Wrong number of batteries reported

I only have one battery but after one suspend/resume cycle, *GPM* thinks
I have two. Maybe this is a bug of *UPower*. Maybe this is
[bug #606434][606434]. I did not investigate it. Maybe there is an
happy interaction with [bug #456280][456280].

## Inability to set configure actions when the UPS runs out of battery

This is [bug #390602][390602]. In addition to laptop batteries, *UPower*
also supports UPS. In this case, *GPM* displays a special icon to tell
if the UPS is fully charged. However, there is no possibility to
execute special actions when the UPS is unplugged, like hibernate
after 10 minutes or something like this. This seems to be a problem
with the interface because looking with `gconftool-2`, we can spot
variables like `low_ups` or `critical_ups` which allows us to set actions
when the UPS is almost out of battery.

Moreover, the UPS icon only displays after one suspend/resume cycle
but I am too lazy to report and debug this issue. Since, the icon
disappear if I restart *GPM*, I am confident that the
bug is in *GPM*.

# Conclusion

The conclusion is that *GPM* is not really that buggy but it really
needs to be run in a full-blown GNOME desktop. The main problem is not
really *GPM*. New technologies like *UPower* and *ConsoleKit* get pushed by
freedesktop.org initiative, they get implemented by GNOME (and, I
suppose, KDE) because they have tons of people following the
appropriate mailing lists and any alternative just gets crushed by all
those unpublicized changes.

**UPDATED:** I got several helpful comments about this problem. There
are two possible solutions:

 1. Use `xfce4-power-manager`. It handles brightness control in a
 better way and don't need an external program to tell when the
 current session is idle. It still needs a session manager to ask what
 to do when using the power button. The drawback to this solution is
 that you start to pull another desktop environment into your
 environment. You had some parts of GNOME and now you have some parts
 of XFCE. This solution was proposed by
 [Sylvain Collilieux](http://collilieux.net/blog).
 
 2. Use `gnome-session`, `gnome-screensaver` and keep
 `gnome-power-manager`. As pointed by Julien Valroff,
 `gnome-screensaver` needs `gnome-session` to detect
 idleness. However, `gnome-session` starts a whole GNOME
 desktop. Again, there are two solutions. The first one is to
 [replace `gnome-session` by something lighter][a1] implementing the
 bare minimum to make `gnome-screensaver`
 happy. Another suggestion is to configure `gnome-session` to
 start your favorite environment.

I start mine from `~/.xsession` and here is what I have added at the
top of it:

    ::sh
    # If not done, restart ourself with gnome-session
    if [ -z "$SESSION_MANAGER" ]; then
        [ -d ~/.config/autostart ] || mkdir ~/.config/autostart
        rm -f ~/.config/autostart/*
        cat <<EOF > ~/.config/autostart/xsession.desktop
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Xsession
    Comment=Start .xsession
    Exec=$(readlink -f $0)
    Type=Application
    X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
    EOF
        exec gnome-session --autostart=$HOME/.config/autostart
    fi
    # Otherwise, keep starting stuff
    # [...]
    exec fvwm-crystal
