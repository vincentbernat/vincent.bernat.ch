Session reuse is one of the most important mechanisms to [improve TLS
performance][1]: by submitting an appropriate blob to the server, a
client can trigger an abbreviated handshake, improving latency and
computation time. There exist two distinct ways to achieve session
reuse: **session identifiers** as described in [RFC 5246][rfc5246] and
**session tickets** as depicted in [RFC 5077][rfc5077].

!!! "Update (2018-08)" While the content of this article is still
technically sound, ensure you understand it was written by the end of
2011 and therefore doesn't take into account many important aspects,
like the compatibility progression of implementations with RFC 5077
and the fall of RC4 as an appropriate cipher. Moreover, TLS 1.3
replaced both session identifiers and session tickets with a [new
mechanism](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-2.2).

# Theory of operation

To establish a TLS connection, four messages need to be exchanged
between client and server. With a latency of 50 ms, we have a 200 ms
overhead to establish the connection (plus TCP handshake). Moreover,
to share a common secret, both the client and the server need to
achieve some public-key cryptographic operations which are costly,
computation-wise.

![TLS full handshake][s1]
[s1]: [[!!images/benchs-ssl/ssl-handshake.svg]] "Full TLS handshake"

To avoid a full TLS handshake each time a client requests a resource,
it can ask for an abbreviated handshake, saving a complete round-trip
(100 ms) and avoiding the costliest part of the full TLS handshake.

![TLS abbreviated handshake][s2]
[s2]: [[!!images/benchs-ssl/ssl-handshake-with-resume.svg]] "Abbreviated TLS handshake"

Two mechanisms can be used to accomplish an abbreviated handshake:

1. When the server sends the "Server Hello" message, it can include a
   **session identifier**. The client should store it and present it
   in the "Client Hello" message of the next session. If the server
   finds the corresponding session in its cache and accepts to resume
   the session, it will send back the same session identifier and will
   continue with the abbreviated TLS handshake. Otherwise, it will
   issue a new session identifier and switch to a full handshake. This
   mechanism is detailed in [RFC 5246][rfc5246]. It is the most common
   mechanism because it exists since earlier versions of TLS.

2. In the last exchange of a full TLS handshake, the server can
   include a "New Session Ticket" message (not represented in the
   handshake described in the picture) which will contain the complete
   session state (including the master secret negotiated between the
   client and the server and the cipher suite used). Therefore, this
   state is encrypted and integrity-protected by a key known only by
   the server. This opaque datum is known as a **session ticket**. The
   details lie in [RFC 5077][rfc5077] which supersedes
   [RFC 4507][rfc4507].

The ticket mechanism is a TLS extension. The client can advertise its
support by sending an empty "Session Ticket" extension in the "Client
Hello" message. The server will answer with an empty "Session Ticket"
extension in its "Server Hello" message if it supports it. If one of
them does not support this extension, they can fall back to the
session identifier mechanism built into TLS.

[RFC 5077][rfc5077] identifies situations where tickets are desirable
over session identifiers. The main improvement is to avoid to maintain
a server-side session cache since the whole session state is
remembered by the client, not the server. A session cache can be
costly in terms of memory and difficult to share between multiple hosts
when requests are load-balanced across servers.

# Browser support

Session identifiers are part of TLS and are therefore supported for a
long time by clients and servers. <del>However, session tickets are an
optional TLS extension and therefore, the support is not as widespread
as for session identifiers.</del> Support for tickets was added in
[OpenSSL][openssl] 0.9.8f (October 2007). In [GnuTLS][gnutls], this is
version 2.9.3 (August 2009). For [NSS][nss], the set of libraries
behind most browsers, support of RFC 5077 is in version 3.12 (June
2008). For [Schannel][schannel], Microsoft implementation of TLS,
support was added in Windows 8.1 and Windows 2012 R2.

To check if a browser supports session resume without and with
tickets, I have written a [web server][rfc5077-server] listening to
several ports with different configurations (session cache disabled or
enabled, ticket support disabled or enabled). With the help of some
Javascript, it is possible to interact with this server to determine
what kind of session resume a browser support.

![Checking for browser support for session resume][s3]
[s3]: [[!!images/benchs-ssl/rfc5077-screenshot-v2.png]] "Example of test with Chromium 14"

It is difficult to get extensive results this way since you need to
install a lot of browsers to get something valuable. Surprisingly,
Android 2.3.4 browser (as shipped by Cyanogen Mod) does not support
any session resume.

Another way to check if a browser supports session resume is to use a
sniffer and to spot "Client Hello" messages. If a client tries to
resume a session, it will use an appropriate session identifier or
send a ticket. A simple [program parsing PCAP files][rfc5077-pcap]
allows one to automate this task and get some interesting statistics. Here
are random facts from more than 300 000 requests (38 000 clients) to
a customer care service of an important French telco:

- 35% of requests exhibit support of tickets;
- 53.3% of requests ask to resume without tickets; 25.6% with tickets;
- 67.2% of requests exhibit support of [SNI][sni];
- 86.7% of requests use TLS 1.0; the remaining uses SSL 3.0; almost no TLS
  1.1/1.2;
- on average, a client execute 8 TLS handshakes;
- ciphers supported by all clients are 3DES-SHA, RC4-MD5, and RC4-SHA.

With some log analysis to match each request with the appropriate user
agent, we can split the world into two parts: browsers supporting RFC
5077 (Chrome and Firefox) and browsers not supporting RFC 5077
(Internet Explorer, Opera 9.80, Safari for macOS and iOS and Android
browser).

# Web server support

There is no unique recipe to configure a web server to handle
appropriately and efficiently session resume. Here are some general
directions:

- if the web server uses multiple processes, you need to configure a
  shared memory session cache; usually, tickets will work just fine in
  this setup;
- if you use local load-balancing, one easy way to avoid any problem
  is to use ensure that one IP is mapped to one server (either
  statically with hashing or dynamically with a stick table); if your
  load-balancer understands TLS, you can also use session identifier
  (and disable tickets[^1]) to build a stick
  table;
- if you don't want to apply the previous advice, you need to share
  the session cache between the servers with something like
  [memcached][memcached] and disable tickets;
- if you use global load-balancing (DNS based), there
  is no need to ensure that session resumption works across geographic
  pools since a user will usually stick to one pool.

[^1]: [RFC 5077][rfc5077] describes interactions between session
      identifiers and session tickets. When using tickets, the server
      *should* send back an empty session identifier. The client *may*
      present an empty session identifier or generate one. However,
      for all practical purposes, it seems that servers send back a
      non-empty session identifier and clients just stick to this
      identifier. Please, investigate if you want to use TLS session
      identifiers for load-balancing while keeping tickets enabled.

Remember that only one client out of three supports TLS
tickets. Therefore, you cannot rely on them to ensure proper session
resume. You need a session cache.

## Setting a session cache with Apache & nginx

**Apache** features two different TLS engines. The first one is
[mod_ssl][modssl] and uses OpenSSL as the backend. It is possible to
setup a shared session cache with `SSLSessionCache` but the
memcached-enabled session cache is [available only in the development
branch][modssl-memcached]. You can also get one by switching to
[mod_gnutls][modgnutls] backend. The cache is enabled with
`GnuTLSCache`. In this case, do not enable tickets because they cannot
be shared.

With **nginx**, you need to enable the shared session cache with
`ssl_session_cache`. Currently, it lacks a memcached-enabled session
cache but [Matt Palmer has some patches to add it][nginxcaching] to
the 0.8 branch. However, these patches can have a serious impact on
nginx performance since retrieving a session from memcached is done
synchronously (mostly because of a limitation in OpenSSL design who
does not allow us to register asynchronous callbacks with
`SSL_CTX_sess_set_get_cb()`).

As a proof of concept, I have also added a similar feature to
[stud][], the scalable TLS unwrapping daemon, a very efficient
network proxy terminating TLS connections. The same limitation as for
*nginx* applies: performance will suffer. Look at the
[pull request][pr] for more details.

## Sharing tickets

[RFC 5077][rfc5077] explains that tickets allow us to load-balance
requests across servers. However, to the best of my knowledge, there
is currently no web server able to share tickets across a pool. When a
server initializes its TLS stack, it will randomly generate some keys
that will be used to protect and encrypt tickets. In OpenSSL, from
`ssl/ssl_lib.c`:

    ::c
    /* Setup RFC4507 ticket keys */
    if ((RAND_pseudo_bytes(ret->tlsext_tick_key_name, 16) <= 0)
            || (RAND_bytes(ret->tlsext_tick_hmac_key, 16) <= 0)
            || (RAND_bytes(ret->tlsext_tick_aes_key, 16) <= 0))
            ret->options |= SSL_OP_NO_TICKET;

Therefore, with a round-robin load-balanced pool of servers, tickets
have to be disabled because servers would not accept tickets from
neighbors. One way to solve this is to generate keys deterministically
by hashing some common secret with the private key. I have implemented
this approach for *stud*. Here is a simplified version (no error
handling, no allocation) of the [pull request for this feature][pr2]:

    ::c
    unsigned char keys[48];
    EVP_PKEY *pkey = grab_private_key();

    /* To get our key, we sign the seed with the private key */
    unsigned int siglen;
    unsigned char sign[LARGE_ENOUGH];
    EVP_MD_CTX mdctx;
    EVP_MD_CTX_init(&mdctx);
    EVP_SignInit(&mdctx, EVP_sha256());
    EVP_SignUpdate(&mdctx, some_secret, strlen(some_secret));
    EVP_SignFinal(&mdctx, sign, &siglen, pkey);

    /* And we keep only the first bytes. */
    memcpy(keys, sign, sizeof(keys));

    /* Tell OpenSSL to use these keys */
    SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_keys(ctx, keys, sizeof(keys));

[pr2]: https://github.com/bumptech/stud/pull/30

!!! "Update (2011-11)" [Paul Querna](https://twitter.com/pquerna/) has
added [support for configuring keys protecting session tickets in
Apache HTTPD][ticket-httpd].  This adds two new directives:
`SSLTicketKeyFile` and `SSLTicketKeyDefault`.

[ticket-httpd]: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1200040 "Commit 1200040 in Apache HTTPD SVN"

!!! "Update (2011-11)" If you care about perfect forward secrecy like
the one provided by cipher suites like `DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA`, using
tickets this way will weaken it. The keys should be rotated in some
synchronized way.

## Testing

While tests can be done with just `openssl s_client` and `openssl
sess_id`, testing all aspects can take a lot of time. For this
purpose, I have written a
[client testing session resume with and without tickets][rfc5077-client]. Here
is a typical result:

![twitter.com RFC session resume][s4]
[s4]: [[!!images/benchs-ssl/rfc5077-twitter.png]] "Example of test with twitter.com"

The program will try to establish five consecutive TLS connections for
each IP without and with tickets. For each IP, the last four TLS
connections should always reuse the first TLS session. Here, Twitter
web servers seem properly configured: for each IP, session resume is
successful. Their web servers do not support tickets or they may have
disabled it because they share the session cache between servers
inside the same pool.
