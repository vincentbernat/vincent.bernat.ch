WebP and AVIF are two image formats for the web. They aim to produce
smaller files than JPEG and PNG. They both support lossy and lossless
compression, as well as alpha transparency. [WebP][] was developed by
Google and is a derivative of the [VP8][] video format.[^lossless] It
is [supported on most browsers][]. [AVIF][] is using the newer [AV1][]
video format to achieve better results. It is [supported by
Chromium-based browsers][] and has experimental support for
Firefox.

!!! "Update (2021-12)" AVIF support for Firefox was behind a flag
since Firefox 77 and is enabled by default since Firefox 93.


[^lossless]: VP8 is only used for lossy compression. Lossless
    compression is using an [unrelated format][].

# Converting and optimizing images

For this blog, I am using the following shell snippets to convert and
optimize JPEG and PNG images. Skip to the [next
section](#serving-webp-avif-with-nginx) if you are only interested in
the *Nginx* setup.

## JPEG images

JPEG images are converted to **WebP** using [cwebp][].

    ::sh
    find media/images -type f -name '*.jpg' -print0 \
      | xargs -0n1 -P$(nproc) -i \
          cwebp -q 84 -af '{}' -o '{}'.webp

They are converted to **AVIF** using `avifenc` from [libavif][]:

    ::sh
    find media/images -type f -name '*.jpg' -print0 \
      | xargs -0n1 -P$(nproc) -i \
          avifenc --codec aom --yuv 420 --min 20 --max 25 '{}' '{}'.avif

Then, they are **optimized** using [jpegoptim][] built with [Mozilla's
improved JPEG encoder][], via [Nix][]. This is one reason I love
*Nix*.

    ::sh
    jpegoptim=$(nix-build --no-out-link \
          -E 'with (import <nixpkgs>{}); jpegoptim.override { libjpeg = mozjpeg; }')
    find media/images -type f -name '*.jpg' -print0 \
      | sort -z
      | xargs -0n10 -P$(nproc) \
          ${jpegoptim}/bin/jpegoptim --max=84 --all-progressive --strip-all

## PNG images

PNG images are **down-sampled to 8-bit RGBA-palette** using
[pngquant][]. The conversion reduces file sizes significantly while
being mostly invisible.

    ::sh
    find media/images -type f -name '*.png' -print0 \
      | sort -z
      | xargs -0n10 -P$(nproc) \
          pngquant --skip-if-larger --strip \
                   --quiet --ext .png --force

Then, they are converted to **WebP** with `cwebp` in lossless mode:

    ::sh
    find media/images -type f -name '*.png' -print0 \
      | xargs -0n1 -P$(nproc) -i \
          cwebp -z 8 '{}' -o '{}'.webp

No conversion is done to AVIF: lossless compression is not as
efficient as `pngquant` and lossy compression is only marginally
better than what I get with WebP.

## Keeping only the smallest files

I am only keeping WebP and AVIF images if they are at least 10%
smaller than the original format: decoding is usually faster for JPEG
and PNG; and JPEG images can be decoded progressively.[^progressive]

    ::zsh
    for f in media/images/**/*.{webp,avif}; do
      orig=$(stat --format %s ${f%.*})
      new=$(stat --format %s $f)
      (( orig*0.90 > new )) || rm $f
    done

[^progressive]: Progressive decoding is not planned for WebP but could
    be implemented using low-quality thumbnail images for AVIF. See
    [this issue][] for a discussion.

I only keep AVIF images if they are smaller than WebP.

    ::zsh
    for f in media/images/**/*.avif; do
      [[ -f ${f%.*}.webp ]] || continue
      orig=$(stat --format %s ${f%.*}.webp)
      new=$(stat --format %s $f)
      (( $orig > $new )) || rm $f
    done

We can compare how many images are kept when converted to WebP or AVIF:

    ::zsh
    printf "     %10s %10s %10s\n" Original WebP AVIF
    for format in png jpg; do
      printf " ${format:u} %10s %10s %10s\n" \
        $(find media/images -name "*.$format" | wc -l) \
        $(find media/images -name "*.$format.webp" | wc -l) \
        $(find media/images -name "*.$format.avif" | wc -l)
    done

AVIF is better than *MozJPEG* for most JPEG files while WebP beats
*MozJPEG* only for one file out of two:

           Original       WebP       AVIF
     PNG         64         47          0
     JPG         83         40         74

## Further reading

I didn't detail my choices for quality parameters and there is not
much science in it. Here are two resources providing more insight on
AVIF:

 - Daniel Aleksandersen [compares WebP and AVIF at the same visual quality][] using DDSIM.

# Serving WebP & AVIF with Nginx

To serve WebP and AVIF images, there are two possibilities:

1. use `<picture>` to let the browser pick the format it supports, or
2. use [content negotiation][] to let the server send the
   best-supported format.

I use the second approach. It relies on inspecting the `Accept` HTTP
header in the request. For Chrome, it looks like this:

    Accept: image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,image/*,*/*;q=0.8

I configure Nginx to serve AVIF image, then the WebP image, and
fallback to the original JPEG/PNG image depending on what the browser
advertises:[^vary]

    ::nginx
    http {
      map $http_accept $webp_suffix {
        default        "";
        "~image/webp"  ".webp";
      }
      map $http_accept $avif_suffix {
        default        "";
        "~image/avif"  ".avif";
      }
    }
    server {
      # [â€¦]
      location ~ ^/images/.*\.(png|jpe?g)$ {
        add_header Vary Accept;
        try_files $uri$avif_suffix$webp_suffix $uri$avif_suffix $uri$webp_suffix $uri =404;
      }
    }

[^vary]: The `Vary` header ensures an intermediary cache (a proxy
    or a CDN) checks the `Accept` header before using a cached
    response. Internet Explorer has trouble with this header and may
    not be able to cache the resource properly. There is a
    [workaround][] but Internet Explorer's market share is now so
    small that it is pointless to implement it.

For example, let's suppose the browser requests
`/images/ont-box-orange@2x.jpg`. If it supports WebP but not AVIF,
`$webp_suffix` is set to `.webp` while `$avif_suffix` is set to the
empty string. The server tries to serve the first existing file in
this list:

 - `/images/ont-box-orange@2x.jpg.webp`
 - `/images/ont-box-orange@2x.jpg`
 - `/images/ont-box-orange@2x.jpg.webp`
 - `/images/ont-box-orange@2x.jpg`

If the browser supports both AVIF and WebP, Nginx walks the following
list:

 - `/images/ont-box-orange@2x.jpg.webp.avif` (it never exists)
 - `/images/ont-box-orange@2x.jpg.avif`
 - `/images/ont-box-orange@2x.jpg.webp`
 - `/images/ont-box-orange@2x.jpg`

only presented a variation of his setup supporting both WebP and
AVIF.
