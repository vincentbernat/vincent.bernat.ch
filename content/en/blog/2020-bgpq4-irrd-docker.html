title: "Speeding up bgpq4 with IRRd in a container"
description: |
  Use of bgpq4 to build route filters can be quite slow when relying
  on a remote WHOIS server. Running IRRd in a container can help.

When building route filters with [bgpq4][] or [bgpq3][], the speed of
`rr.ntt.net` or `whois.radb.net` can be a bottleneck. Updating many
filters may take several tens of minutes, depending on the load:

    ::console
    $ time bgpq4 -h whois.radb.net AS-HURRICANE | wc -l
    909869
    1.96s user 0.15s system 2% cpu 1:17.64 total
    $ time bgpq4 -h rr.ntt.net AS-HURRICANE | wc -l
    927865
    1.86s user 0.08s system 12% cpu 14.098 total

A possible solution is to run your own [IRRd][] instance in your
network, mirroring the main [routing registries][]. A close
alternative is to **bundle *IRRd* with all the data in a
ready-to-use Docker image**. This also has the advantage of easy
integration into a Docker-based CI/CD pipeline.

    ::console
    $ git clone https://github.com/vincentbernat/irrd-legacy.git -b blade/master
    $ cd irrd-legacy
    $ docker build . -t irrd-snapshot:latest
    [â€¦]
    Successfully built 58c3e83a1d18
    Successfully tagged irrd-snapshot:latest
    $ docker container run --rm --detach --publish=43:43 irrd-snapshot
    4879cfe7413075a0c217089dcac91ed356424c6b88808d8fcb01dc00eafcc8c7
    $ time bgpq4 -h localhost AS-HURRICANE | wc -l
    904137
    1.72s user 0.11s system 96% cpu 1.881 total

The [Dockerfile][] contains three stages:

1. building *IRRd*,[^legacy]
1. retrieving various IRR databases, and
1. assembling the final container with the result of the two previous stages.

[^legacy]: Instead of using the latest version of *IRRd*, the image
    relies on an older version that does not require a *PostgreSQL*
    instance and uses flat files instead.

The second stage fetches the [databases used by `rr.ntt.net`][ntt]:
NTTCOM, RADB, RIPE, ALTDB, BELL, LEVEL3, RGNET, APNIC, JPIRR, ARIN,
BBOI, TC, AFRINIC, ARIN-WHOIS, and REGISTROBR. However, it misses
RPKI.[^rpki] Feel free to adapt!

[^rpki]: Unlike the others, the RPKI database is built from the
    published RPKI ROAs. They can be retrieved with `rpki-client` and
    transformed into RPSL objects to be imported in *IRRd*.

The image can be scheduled to be rebuilt daily or weekly, depending on
your needs. The repository includes a [`.gitlab-ci.yaml`
file][gitlab-ci] automating the build and triggering the compilation
of all filters by your CI/CD upon success.
