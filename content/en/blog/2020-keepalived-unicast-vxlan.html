title: "Keepalived and unicast over multiple interfaces"
description: |
  When Keepalived is configured to send unicast VRRP packets, it
  only handles one interface for transmit and receive. Here is
  a workaround using VXLAN.

[Keepalived][] is a Linux implementation of [VRRP][]. The usual role
of VRRP is to **share a virtual IP** across a set of routers. For each
VRRP instance, a leader is elected and gets to serve the IP address,
ensuring the high availability of the attached service. *Keepalived*
can also be used for a **generic leader election**, thanks to its
ability to use scripts for health checking and run commands on state
change.

A simple configuration looks like this:

    ::junos
    vrrp_instance gateway1 {
      state BACKUP          # ❶
      interface eth0        # ❷
      virtual_router_id 12  # ❸
      priority 101          # ❹
      virtual_ipaddress {
        2001:db8:ff/64
      }
    }

The `state` keyword in ❶ instructs *Keepalived* to not take the leader
role when starting. Otherwise, incoming nodes create a temporary
disruption by taking over the IP address until the election settles.
The `interface` keyword in ❷ defines the interface for sending and
receiving VRRP packets. It is also the default interface to configure
the virtual IP address. The `virtual_router_id` directive in ❸ is
common to all nodes sharing the virtual IP. The `priority` keyword in
❹ helps to choose which router will be elected as leader. If you need
more information about *Keepalived*, be sure to check the
[documentation][].


VRRP design is tied to Ethernet networks and requires a
multicast-enabled network for communication between nodes. In some
environments, notably public clouds, multicast is unavailable. In this
case, *Keepalived* can send VRRP packets using unicast:

    ::junos hl_lines="6 7 8 9"
    vrrp_instance gateway1 {
      state BACKUP
      interface eth0
      virtual_router_id 12
      priority 101
      unicast_peer {
        2001:db8::11
        2001:db8::12
      }
      virtual_ipaddress {
        2001:db8:ff/64 dev lo
      }
    }

Another process, like a BGP daemon, should advertise the virtual IP
address to the "network." If needed, *Keepalived* can trigger whatever
action is needed for this by using `notify_*` scripts.

Until version 2.21 (not released yet), the `interface` directive is
mandatory and *Keepalived* will transmit and receive VRRP packets on
this interface only. If peers are reachable through several
interfaces, like on a [BGP on the host][] setup, you need a
workaround. A simple one is to use a VXLAN interface:

    ::console
    $ ip -6 link add keepalived6 type vxlan id 6 dstport 4789 local 2001:db8::10 nolearning
    $ bridge fdb append 00:00:00:00:00:00 dev keepalived6 dst 2001:db8::11
    $ bridge fdb append 00:00:00:00:00:00 dev keepalived6 dst 2001:db8::12
    $ ip link set up dev keepalived6

Learning of MAC addresses is disabled and one generic entry for each
peer is added in the forwarding database: **transmitted packets are
broadcasted to all peers**, notably VRRP packets. Have a look at
"[VXLAN & Linux][]" for additional details.

    ::junos hl_lines="3 4"
    vrrp_instance gateway1 {
      state BACKUP
      interface keepalived6
      mcast_src_ip 2001:db8::10
      virtual_router_id 12
      priority 101
      virtual_ipaddress {
        2001:db8:ff/64 dev lo
      }
    }

Starting from *Keepalived* 2.21, `unicast_peer` can be used [without
the `interface` directive][commit]. I think using VXLAN is still a
neat trick applicable to other situations where communication using
broadcast or multicast is needed, while the underlying network provides
no support for this.
