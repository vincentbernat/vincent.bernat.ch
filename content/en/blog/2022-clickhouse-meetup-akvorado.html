Here are the slides I presented for a [ClickHouse SF Bay Area Meetup in
July 2022][], hosted by [Altinity][]. They are about [Akvorado][], a
network flow collector and visualizer, and notably on how it relies on
[ClickHouse][], a column-oriented database.

The meetup was recorded and available on [YouTube][]. Here is the part
relevant to my presentation, with subtitles:[^subtitles]

[^subtitles]: To generate the subtitles, I have used [Amazon
    Transcribe][], the speech-to-text solution from *Amazon AWS*.
    Unfortunately, there is no `en-FR` language available, which would
    have been useful for my <del>terrible</del> accent. While the
    subtitles were 100% accurate when the host, Robert Hodge from
    *Altinity*, was speaking, the success rate on my talk was quite
    lower. I had to rewrite almost all sentences. However, using
    speech-to-text is still useful to get the timings, as it is also
    something requiring a lot of work to do manually.

I got a few questions about how to get information from the higher
layers, like HTTP. As my use case for Akvorado was at the network
edge, my answers were mostly negative. However, as sFlow is
extensible, when collecting flows from Linux servers instead, you
could embed additional data and they could be exported as well.

I also got a question about doing aggregation in a single table.
ClickHouse can aggregate automatically data using TTL. My answer for
not doing that is partial. There is another reason: the retention
periods of the various tables may overlap. For example, the main table
keeps data for 15 days, but even in these 15 days, if I do a query on
a 12-hour window, it is faster to use the `flows_1m0s` aggregated
table, unless I request something about ports and IP addresses.
