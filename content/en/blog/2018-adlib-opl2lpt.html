The [AdLib sound card][] was the first popular sound card for IBM
PC‚Äîbefore that, we were pampered by the sound of the PC
speaker. Connected to an 8-bit ISA slot, it is powered by a [Yamaha
YM3812][] chip, also known as *OPL2*. This chip can drive 9 sound
channels whose characteristics can be fine-tuned through 244
write-only registers.

![AdLib sound card]([[!!images/pc-cards/adlib-copy@2x.jpg]] "A copy of an AdLib sound card from <a href='https://monotech.fwscart.com/AdLib_OPL2_Sound_Card/p6083514_19478748.aspx'>Monotech</a>. The OPL2 chip is in the lower right part. Notable differences with the original include the volume potentiometer and the metal film resistors‚Äîinstead of carbon film resistors.")

I had one but I am unable to locate it anymore. Models on eBay are
quite rare and expensive. It is possible to build one yourself (either
[Sergey's one][] or this [faithful reproduction][]). However, you
still need an ISA port. The limitless imagination of some hackers can
still help here. For example, you can combine [Sergey's Xi 8088
processor board][], with his [ISA 8-bit backplane][], his [Super VGA
card][], and his [XT-CF-Lite card][] to get your very own modernish IBM
PC compatible. Alternatively, you can look at the [AdLib sound card on
a parallel port][] from Rapha√´l Ass√©nat.

# The OPL2LPT sound card

Recently, the [8-Bit Guy][] released a video about an [AdLib sound
card for the parallel port][], the [OPL2LPT][]. While current
motherboards don't have a parallel port anymore, it's easy to add a
[PCI-Express one][]. I bought a pre-soldered *OPL2LPT* and a few
days later, it was at my doorstep:

![OPL2LPT sound card]([[!!images/opl2lpt@2x.jpg]] "The OPL2LPT sound card on an original ‚ÄúDay of the Tentacle‚Äù box to indicate scale.")

!!! "Update (2018-03)" <del>You can also buy a 3D-printed enclosure for
the *OPL2LPT*.</del> After writing this article, I have been offered one:

![OPL2LPT enclosure]([[!!images/opl2lpt-case@2x.jpg]] "The OPL2LPT sound card in its 3D-printed enclosure on a ‚ÄúMonkey Island 4‚Äù box.")

!!! "Update (2018-07)" The [OPL3LPT][] is now available. It features a
similar design but with an OPL3 chip.

The expected mode of operation for such a device is to plug it into an
ISA parallel port (accessible through I/O port 0x378), load a [DOS
driver][] to intercept calls to AdLib's address, and run some
AdLib-compatible game. While correctly supported by Linux, the
PCI-Express parallel port doesn't operate like an ISA one. [QEMU][]
comes with a parallel port emulation but, due to [timing issues][],
cannot correctly drive the *OPL2LPT*. However, [VirtualBox][]
emulation is good enough.[^vbox]

[^vbox]: There is no dialog to configure a parallel port. This needs
    to be done from the command-line after the instance creation:
    
        ::console
        $ VBoxManage modifyvm "FreeDOS (games)" --lptmode1 /dev/parport0
        $ VBoxManage modifyvm "FreeDOS (games)" --lpt1 0x378 7

On Linux, the *OPL2LPT* can be programmed almost like an [actual
AdLib][prog]. The following code writes a value to a register:

    ::c
    static void lpt_write(uint8_t data, uint8_t ctrl) {
      ieee1284_write_data(port, data);
      ieee1284_write_control(port, (ctrl | C1284_NINIT) ^ C1284_INVERTED);
      ieee1284_write_control(port,  ctrl                ^ C1284_INVERTED);
      ieee1284_write_control(port, (ctrl | C1284_NINIT) ^ C1284_INVERTED);
    }
    
    void opl_write(uint8_t reg, uint8_t value) {
      lpt_write(reg, C1284_NSELECTIN | C1284_NSTROBE);
      usleep(4); // 3.3 microseconds
    
      lpt_write(value, C1284_NSELECTIN);
      usleep(23);
    }

To "natively" use the *OPL2LPT*, I have modified the following
applications:

 - [ScummVM][], an emulator for classic point-and-click adventure games, including
   many Lucas¬≠Arts games‚Äî[patch][scummvm-patch][^scummvm]
 - [QEMU][], a quick generic emulator‚Äî[patch][qemu-patch] with a minimal emulation
   for timers and hard-coded sleep delays üôÑ
 - [DOSBox][], an x86 emulator bundled with DOS‚Äî[patch][dosbox-patch]
   with a complete emulation for timers and a dedicated working thread[^delays]

[^scummvm]: The patch for *ScummVM* has been merged. Support for the
    *OPL2LPT* should appear in the 2.1 release. At compile-time, the
    `--enable-opl2lpt` option should be specified.

[^delays]: With *QEMU* or *DOSBox*, it should be the responsibility of
    the executing game to respect the required delays for the OPL2 to
    process the received bytes. However, *QEMU* doesn't seem to try to
    emulate I/O delays while *DOSBox* <del>seems to not be precise
    enough</del> <ins>works with 1-ms chunks of time</ins>. For the
    latter, the *OPL2LPT* is managed from a dedicated thread receiving
    the writes and ensuring the required delays are met.

You can compare the results in the following video, with the
introduction of [Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade][], released in
1989:[^nostalgia]

 - [6:10](#video-seek-370), **ScummVM** with the **CD track** ([FM Towns][] version)

[^nostalgia]: *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* was the first game
    I tried after plugging in the brand new AdLib sound card I
    compelled my parents to buy on a trip to Canada in 1992. At the
    time, no brick and mortar retailer sold this card in my French
    city and online purchases (through the [Minitel][]) were limited
    to consumer goods (like a VHS player). Hard times. üòè
    
    The video is running the VGA version (320√ó200,
    256 colors), released in 1990. However, back in the time, I
    was playing the CGA/EGA version (320√ó200, 4 fixed colors or
    640√ó350, 16 colors from a palette of 64).

I let you judge how good is each option! There are two ways to buy an
<del>*OPL2LPT*</del> *OPL3LPT*: in Europe, from [Serdashop][OPL3LPT]
or in North America, from [The 8-Bit Guy][OPL3LPT-US].

# Addendum

## Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis

Here is another video featuring [Indiana Jones and the Fate of
Atlantis][], released in 1992, running in *DOSBox* with the
*OPL2LPT*. It's the second game using the [iMUSE][] sound system:
music is synchronized with actions and transitions are done
seamlessly. Quite a feat at the time!

![]([[!!videos/2018-adlib-opl2lpt-2-indy4.m3u8]])

## Monkey Island 2

The first game featuring *iMuse* is [Monkey Island 2][], released
in 1991. The video below displays the first minutes of the game,
running in *DOSBox* with the *OPL2LPT*.

![]([[!!videos/2018-adlib-opl2lpt-3-monkey2.m3u8]])

Notably, at [5:33](#video-seek-333), when Guybrush is in Woodtick, a
small town on Scabb Island, the music plays around a variation of a
basic theme with a different instrument for each place without any
interruption.

## How the videos were recorded

With a VGA adapter, many games use [Mode 13h][], a 256-color mode with
a 320√ó200 resolution. On a 4:3 display, this mode doesn't feature
square pixels: they are stretched vertically by a factor of 1.2.

The above videos were recorded with [FFmpeg][] (and edited with
[Blender][]). It packs a lot of [useful filters][] making it easy to
automate video capture. Here is an example:

    ::shell
    FONT="font=Monkey Island 1991 refined:
          fontcolor=OrangeRed:
          fontsize=16:
          x=w-text_w-10"
    ffmpeg -y \
      -thread_queue_size 64 \
      -f x11grab -draw_mouse 0 -r 30 -s 640x400 -i :0+844,102 \
      -thread_queue_size 64 \
      -f pulse -ac 1 -i default \
      -filter_complex "[0:v]pad=854:400:0:0,
           drawtext=${FONT}:y= 10:text=Indiana Jones 3,
           drawtext=${FONT}:y= 34:text=Intro,
           drawtext=${FONT}:y=100:text=DOSBox,
           drawtext=${FONT}:y=124:text=VGA,
           drawtext=${FONT}:y=148:text=PC speaker,
           scale=854:480:flags=neighbor[game];
           [1:a]volumedetect;
           [1:a]showwaves=s=214x100:colors=OrangeRed:scale=lin[waves];
           [1:a]showcqt=s=214x100[spectrum];
           [waves][spectrum]vstack[vis];
           [game][vis]overlay=x=640:y=280" \
      -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -qp 0 -preset ultrafast \
      indy3-dosbox-pcspkr.mkv

The interesting part is the `filter_complex` argument. The input video
is [padded][ffmpeg-pad] from 640√ó400 to 854√ó400 as a first step to a
16:9 aspect ratio.[^blur] Using [The Secret Font of Monkey
Island][sfomi], some [text][ffmpeg-drawtext] is added to the right of
the video. The result is then [scaled][ffmpeg-scale] to 854√ó480 to get
the final aspect ratio while stretching pixels to the expected 1.2
factor. The video up to this point is sent to a stream named
`game`. As a second step, from the input audio, we build two
visualizations: a [waveform][ffmpeg-showwaves] and a
[spectrum][ffmpeg-showcqt]. They are [stacked
vertically][ffmpeg-vstack] and the result is a stream named `vis`. The
last step is to [overlay][ffmpeg-overlay] the visualization stream
over the gameplay stream.

[^blur]: A common method to extend a 4:3 video to a 16:9 aspect ratio
    without adding black bars is to add a blurred background using the
    same video as a source. I didn't do this here but it is also
    [possible with FFmpeg][so-blurred]!
