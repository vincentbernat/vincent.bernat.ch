A month ago, I published an article on the compared
[performances of stunnel, nginx and stud][prev] as SSL
terminators. The conclusion was to use [stud][stud] on a 64-bit
system, with session caching and AES. [stunnel][stunnel] was unable to
scale properly and [nginx][nginx] exhibited important latency issues.
I got constructive comments on many aspects. Therefore, here is the
second round. The protagonists are the same but both the conditions
and the conclusions have changed a bit.

[TOC]

# Benchmarks

The hardware platform remains unchanged:

 - [HP DL 380 G7][g7]
 - 6 GB RAM
 - 2 × [L5630 @ 2.13GHz][l5630] (8 cores), hyperthreading disabled
 - 2 × [Intel 82576 NIC][i82576]
 - [Spirent Avalanche 2900][avalanche] appliance

We focus on the following environment:

 - [Ubuntu Lucid][lucid], featuring a patched version of OpenSSL
   0.9.8k with AES-NI builtin and enabled by default
 - 2.6.39 kernel (250 HZ)
 - 64-bit
 - 1 core for [HAProxy][haproxy], 2 cores for network cards[^0], 4 cores
   for SSL, 1 core for the system
 - system limit of 100,000 file descriptors per process

[^0]: *HAProxy* and network cards don't need dedicated core for this
      kind of load. However, if you also want to handle non SSL
      traffic, those dedicated cores can get busy.

On the SSL side, the main components are:

 - 2048-bit certificates
 - AES128-SHA cipher suite
 - 8 HTTP/1.0 requests per client
 - HTTP response payload of 1024 bytes


If you are interested in different conditions (32-bit, number of
cores, 1024-bit certificates, proportion of session reuses), have a
look at [the previous article][prev] whose results on the matter are
still valid. I only consider 2048-bit certificates because most
certificates issued today are 2048-bit. In [SP800-57][sp800-57], NIST
advises that 1024-bit RSA keys will no longer be viable after 2010 and
advises moving to 2048-bit RSA keys:

> If information is initially signed in 2009 and needs to remain
> secure for a maximum of ten years (i.e., from 2009 to 2019), a
> 1024-bit RSA key would not provide sufficient protection between
> 2011 and 2019 and, therefore, it is not recommended that 1024-bit
> RSA be used in this case.

And the protagonists are:

 - [stud][stud], [@e207dbc5a3][e207dbc5a3], with session cache enabled
   for 20,000 sessions, listen backlog of 1000 connections,
 - [stunnel][stunnel] 4.44, configured with `--disable-libwrap
   --with-threads=pthread` ([configuration][stunnelconf]),
 - [nginx][nginx] 1.1.4, configured with `--with-http_ssl_module`
   ([configuration][nginxconf]).

[e207dbc5a3]: https://github.com/vincentbernat/stud/tree/e207dbc5a3d5c2753a4d83794780edf6edb2e3fb "stud branch used for all tests"

**UPDATED:** Configuration of *nginx* has been updated to switch to
`off` both `multi_accept` and `accept_mutex` thanks to the
[feedback of Maxim Dounin on latency issues][0] that were present in
the [previous article][prev] (and still present in the early version
of this article).

[0]: http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2011-September/029243.html "Maxim Dounin's advice on nginx configuration"

[HAProxy][haproxy] ([configuration][haproxyconf]) is used for
*stunnel* and *stud* to add load-balancing.

For each test, we want to maximize the number of HTTP transactions per
second (TPS) while minimizing latency and unsucessful
transactions. The maximum number of allowed failed transactions is set
at 1 transaction out of 1000. The maximum allowed average latency is
100 ms[^1].

[^1]: The real condition is more complex. Each point is considered
      valid if the corresponding average latency is less than 100 ms
      or if the average on the next 8 points is less than
      100 ms. Temporary latency bursts are therefore allowed. We are
      not so forgiveful with failed transactions.

## Control case

Below is the first comparison between *stud*, *nginx* and *stunnel* on
plain Ubuntu Lucid. Like in previous benchs, *stunnel* is not able to
scale, with a maximum of 400 TPS. However, early latency issues of
*nginx* has been solved, thanks to the change in configuration. *stud*
and *nginx* gets similar performance but, as you can see on the bottom
plot (whose scale is logarithmic) *stud* starts with an initial
latency of 40 ms.

This is pretty annoying. I have tried some
[micro optimization to solve this issue][stud-micro] but without
luck. If latency matters for you, stick with *stunnel* or *nginx* (or
find where the problem lies in *stud*).

**UPDATED:** After reporting this issue, a
[fix has been commited][studfix]. The culprit was
[Nagle's algorithm][nagle] which improves bandwidth at the expense of
latency. With the fix, performances are mostly the same but there is
no latency penalty any more.

## OpenSSL 1.0.0e

When I published the first round of benchmarks,
[Michał Trojnara][michal] was dubious about the bad results of
[stunnel][stunnel]. He [told me][tweet1] [on Twitter][tweet2]:

> I solved it! You compiled stunnel against a 4 years old OpenSSL with
> MT-unsafe `SSL_accept`. Upgrade OpenSSL and rebuild stunnel. This
> bug was fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.0b. I implemented a (slow) workaround,
> so stunnel doesn't crash with earlier versions of OpenSSL.

[tweet2]: https://twitter.com/#!/mtrojnar/status/110914736979316737 "Second tweet from Michał"

Therefore, I backported [Ubuntu Oneiric OpenSSL 1.0.0e][oneiric-ssl]
to Ubuntu Lucid[^2] and, as you can see yourself on the plot below,
there is a huge performance boost for *stunnel*: about 400%! *stud*
features a slight improvement too (about 8%) but still starts with a
latency of 40 ms while *nginx* does not improve.

[^2]: This is pretty straighforward: I just
      [dropped multiarch support][oneiric-ssl-backport]. I chose to
      use Ubuntu version of OpenSSL instead of upstream because there
      are some interesting patches, like automatic support of AES-NI.

## Intel Accelerator Engine

Most Linux distributions are still using OpenSSL 0.9.8. For example,
Debian Squeeze ships with OpenSSL 0.9.8o, Ubuntu Lucid with 0.9.8k and
RHEL 5.7 with 0.9.8e. Therefore, they are not eligible to recent
performance improvements. To solve this, Intel released
[Intel Accelerator Engine][intel-accel], which also brings, among
other things, AES-NI support:

> This is essentially a collection of assembler modules from
> development OpenSSL branch, packed together as a standalone engine.
> "Standalone" means that it can be compiled outside OpenSSL source
> tree without patching the latter. Idea is to provide a way to
> utilize new code in already released OpenSSL versions constrained by
> support and release policies limiting their evolvement to genuine
> bug fixes.

Alas, in my tests, there was no improvement compared to OpenSSL 1.0.0e
(already patched with AES-NI support).

*stunnel* comes with out-of-the-box support for additional
engines. Just add something like this to your `stunnel.conf`:

	engine=dynamic
	engineCtrl=SO_PATH:/WOO/intel-accel-1.4/libintel-accel.so
	engineCtrl=ID:intel-accel
	engineCtrl=LIST_ADD:1
	engineCtrl=LOAD
	engineCtrl=INIT

For *stud*, you should grab
[support for engine selection from GitHub][stud-engine] and for
*nginx*, just specify the engine with `ssl_engine`.

## Intel Performance Primitives

In his great article ["Accelerated SSL"][accelerated-ssl], Simon Kuhn
shows huge performance improvements by using
[Intel's IPP library][ipp], a library aimed at leveraging power of
multi-core processors and including some cryptographic primitives and
a patch to make use of them in OpenSSL. Unfortunately, this library is
not free, not even as in "free beer". The patch provided by Intel only
applies on OpenSSL 0.9.8j. Simon updated it for OpenSSL 1.0.0d. It
also applies with a slight modification to OpenSSL 1.0.0e. Look at
[Simon's article][accelerated-ssl] for instructions on how to compile
OpenSSL with IPP.

Simon measured 220% improvement on RSA 1024-bit private key operations
by using this library. Unfortunately, we don't get such a performance
burst with *stud* which exhibits a 15% improvement (but remember that
private key operations only happen once every 8 transactions thanks to
session reuse). Worst, with *stunnel*, performances are reduced by one
third and *nginx* just segfaults. I think such a library is risky to
use in production.

## Hyperthreading

During the previous tests, only half the capacity of each core were
used. For *stud*, adding more workers per core only slightly improves
this situation (less than 10% with 4 workers per core). Therefore, I
thought using hyperthreading could rectify the situation here. In this
case, *stud*, *stunnel* and *nginx* are allocated 8 "virtual" cores
instead of 4. *stud* only got a small improvement of 5%, *nginx* a
moderate improvement of 11% while *stunnel* got a significant
improvement of 26%.

# Conclusion

Here is a quick recap of the maximum TPS reached on each tests (while
keeping average response time below 100 ms). All tests were run on 4
physical cores with 2048-bit certificates, AES128-SHA cipher
suite. Each client makes 8 HTTP requests and reuse the first SSL
session.

Context                     | nginx 1.1.4  | stunnel 4.44  | stud [@e207dbc5a3][e207dbc5a3]
--------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------
OpenSSL 0.9.8k              | 1489 TPS     | 400 TPS       | 1492 TPS
OpenSSL 1.0.0e              | 1501 TPS     | 1561 TPS      | 1609 TPS
OpenSSL 1.0.0e + IPP        | -            | 1101 TPS      | **1857 TPS**
OpenSSL 1.0.0e + HT         | **1718 TPS** | **1973 TPS**  | 1694 TPS

I also would like to stress that below 1500 TPS, *stunnel* adds an
overhead of a few milliseconds while *stud* adds 40 milliseconds. With
OpenSSL 1.0.0e and hyperthreading enabled, *stunnel* has both good
performance and low latency on low loads to moderate loads. You may
just want to limit the number of allowed connections to avoid
collapsing on high loads. While in the [previous round][prev], *stud*
was the champion and *stunnel* lagged behind, the situation is now
reversed : *stunnel* is on top!

**UPDATED:** As said earlier, the latency issue with *stud*
[has been solved][studfix]. Performances remain mostly the same. Here
is how the latest plot looks like after the fix:
