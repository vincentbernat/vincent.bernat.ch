_Net-⁠SNMP_ comes with its own [event loop][] based on the `select()`
system call. While you can build your program around it, you may
prefer to use an existing event loop, either a custom one or something
like [libevent][], [libev][] or [Twisted][].

[TOC]

# Own custom event loop

Let's start with the easiest case: you have written your own event
loop. This means you make a call to `select()`, `poll()`, `epoll()`,
`kqueue()` or something similar. All these functions take a set of
file descriptors and wait for any of them to become available in a
specified time frame.

Here is a typical use of `select()` (adapted from [Quagga][])

    ::c
    readfd = m->readfd;
    writefd = m->writefd;
    exceptfd = m->exceptfd;
    timer_wait = thread_timer_wait (&m->timer);
    num = select (FD_SETSIZE,
                  &readfd, &writefd, &exceptfd,
                  timer_wait);
    if (num < 0)
      {
        if (errno == EINTR)
          continue; /* signal received - process it */
        zlog_warn ("select() error: %s",
                   safe_strerror (errno));
        return NULL;
      }
    if (num == 0)
      {
        /* Timeout handling */
        thread_timer_process (&m->timer);
      }
    if (num > 0)
      {
        thread_process_fd (&readfd);
        thread_process_fd (&writefd);
      }

`thread_process_fd (fds)` function iterates on each file descriptor
`fd` and executes the appropriate action if `FD_ISSET (fds, fd)` is
true.

Integrating _Net-⁠SNMP_ into such an event loop is easy: _Net-⁠SNMP_
provides the `snmp_select_info()` function which alters a set of file
descriptors to insert its own.  Here is the new code:

    ::c
    #if defined HAVE_SNMP
    struct timeval snmp_timer_wait;
    int snmpblock = 0;
    int fdsetsize;
    #endif

    /* ... */

    #if defined HAVE_SNMP
    fdsetsize = FD_SETSIZE;
    snmpblock = 1;
    if (timer_wait)
      {
        snmpblock = 0;
        memcpy(&snmp_timer_wait, timer_wait,
               sizeof(struct timeval));
      }
    snmp_select_info(&fdsetsize, &readfd,
                     &snmp_timer_wait, &snmpblock);
    if (snmpblock == 0)
      timer_wait = &snmp_timer_wait;
    #endif

    num = select (FD_SETSIZE,
                  &readfd, &writefd, &exceptfd,
                  timer_wait);
    if (num < 0) { /* ... */ }

    #if defined HAVE_SNMP
    if (num > 0)
      snmp_read(&readfd);
    else if (num == 0)
      {
        snmp_timeout();
        run_alarms();
      }
    netsnmp_check_outstanding_agent_requests();
    #endif

    /* ... */

`snmp_select_info()` may modify the provided set of file descriptors
(and therefore, its size). It may also modify the provided timer in
case it needs to schedule an action before the original timeout.

`snmpblock` is a tricky variable. While `select()` can be called with
a timeout set to `NULL`, this is not the case for `snmp_select_info()`:
you have to pass a valid pointer. `snmpblock` is set to 0 if the
provided timeout must be considered or to 1
otherwise. `snmp_select_info()` will set `snmpblock` to 0 _if and only
if_ it alters the timeout.

Here are a three examples of integration. They are for a subagent but
the code for a manager is the same:

 - [Quagga](https://github.com/vincentbernat/quagga/blob/feature/agentx/lib/thread.c#L1027-L1158)
 - [Keepalived](https://github.com/vincentbernat/keepalived/blob/snmp/lib/scheduler.c#L501-L701)
 - [PowerDNS](https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/blob/0e663c3b059c1618c99dec6f19f3a3bad32d10c6/pdns/snmp-agent.cc)

# Third-party event loop

With a third party event loop, you don't have access to the `select()`
system call anymore. Therefore, you cannot alter it with
`snmp_select_info()`. Instead, at each iteration of the loop, a list
of SNMP related file descriptors is kept up-to-date with the help of
`snmp_select_info()`: new ones are added and old ones are removed.

## libevent

Let's assume that `snmp_fds` is the list of current SNMP related
events.[^base] A function `levent_snmp_update()` calls
`snmp_select_info()` to update this list. Here is a partial
implementation (error handling removed and some declarations omitted,
look at the
[complete version](https://github.com/lldpd/lldpd/blob/5fd6695c090ddecb77e8324b6d6fb8b8fe43860a/src/event.c#L51-L188)
from [lldpd][]):

    ::c
    static void
    levent_snmp_update()
    {
        int maxfd = 0;
        int block = 1;

        FD_ZERO(&fdset);
        snmp_select_info(&maxfd, &fdset, &timeout, &block);

        /* We need to untrack any event whose FD is not in `fdset`
           anymore */
        for (snmpfd = TAILQ_FIRST(snmp_fds);
             snmpfd;
             snmpfd = snmpfd_next) {
            snmpfd_next = TAILQ_NEXT(snmpfd, next);
            if (event_get_fd(snmpfd->ev) >= maxfd ||
                (!FD_ISSET(event_get_fd(snmpfd->ev), &fdset))) {
                event_free(snmpfd->ev);
                TAILQ_REMOVE(snmp_fds, snmpfd, next);
                free(snmpfd);
            } else
                FD_CLR(event_get_fd(snmpfd->ev), &fdset);
        }

        /* Invariant: FD in `fdset` are not in list of FD */
        for (int fd = 0; fd < maxfd; fd++)
            if (FD_ISSET(fd, &fdset)) {
                snmpfd->ev = event_new(base, fd,
                    EV_READ | EV_PERSIST,
                    levent_snmp_read,
                    NULL);
                event_add(snmpfd->ev, NULL);
                TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL(snmp_fds, snmpfd, next);
            }

        /* If needed, handle timeout */
        evtimer_add(snmp_timeout, block?NULL:&timeout);
    }

[^base]: The event list is global but some code could be added to bind
         a different list for each base in case you use different
         bases. This is not needed in the case of _lldpd_.

Then, replace the main loop (usually, a call to
`event_base_dispatch()`) with this:

    ::c
    do {
        if (event_base_got_break(base) ||
            event_base_got_exit(base))
            break;
        netsnmp_check_outstanding_agent_requests();
        levent_snmp_update();
    } while (event_base_loop(base, EVLOOP_ONCE) == 0);

Here is how are defined the two callbacks:

    ::c
    static void
    levent_snmp_read(evutil_socket_t fd, short what, void *arg)
    {
        FD_ZERO(&fdset);
        FD_SET(fd, &fdset);
        snmp_read(&fdset);
        levent_snmp_update();
    }

    static void
    levent_snmp_timeout(evutil_socket_t fd, short what, void *arg)
    {
        snmp_timeout();
        run_alarms();
        levent_snmp_update();
    }

## Twisted reactor

As a second example, here is how to integrate _Net-⁠SNMP_ into
[Twisted][] reactor. _Twisted_ is an event-driven network programming
framework written in Python. It does not come with support for
SNMP.[^twistedsnmp] Because of the language mismatch, the integration
of _Net-⁠SNMP_ in _Twisted_ needs to be done using a C extension or the
`ctypes` module.[^ffi]

[^twistedsnmp]: [TwistedSNMP][] is an SNMP protocol implementation
                for _Twisted_ based on _PySNMP_ but is not maintained
                anymore. [PySNMP][] comes with examples on how to
                integrate with _Twisted_.

[^ffi]: Nowadays, it should be done with [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

_Twisted_ event loop is called a reactor. Like for _libevent_, events
need to be registered. It is possible to register file descriptor-like
objects using a class implementing a handful of methods. Here is the
implementation of such a class (adapted from _PyNet-⁠SNMP_, a subproject
of [Zenoss][] using the `ctypes` module):

    ::python2
    class SnmpReader:
        "Respond to input events"
        implements(IReadDescriptor)

        def __init__(self, fd):
            self.fd = fd

        def doRead(self):
            netsnmp.snmp_read(self.fd)

        def fileno(self):
            return self.fd

Like for _libevent_, we have a function to update the list of SNMP
related events (stored as a mapping between file descriptors and
`SnmpReader` instances):

    ::python2
    class Timer(object):
        callLater = None
    timer = Timer()
    fdMap = {}

    def updateReactor():
        "Add/remove event handlers for SNMP file descriptors and timers"

        fds, t = netsnmp.snmp_select_info()
        for fd in fds:
            if fd not in fdMap:
                reader = SnmpReader(fd)
                fdMap[fd] = reader
                reactor.addReader(reader)
        current = Set(fdMap.keys())
        need = Set(fds)
        doomed = current - need
        for d in doomed:
            reactor.removeReader(fdMap[d])
            del fdMap[d]
        if timer.callLater:
            timer.callLater.cancel()
            timer.callLater = None
        if t is not None:
            timer.callLater = reactor.callLater(t, checkTimeouts)

Contrary to _libevent_, we cannot alter the main loop to call
`updateReactor()` at each iteration. Therefore, it *must* be called
after each SNMP related function.

For another example, have a look at
[my equivalent implementation as a C extension](https://github.com/vincentbernat/QCss-3/blob/ceb6520305fc7307891173b7bc211f06bcc85ed1/qcss3/collector/snmp.c#L75-L174).

# Miscellaneous

## Lack of asynchronicity

Integrating _Net-⁠SNMP_ into an event-based program is not risk-free. I
have written a fairly comprehensive article on the
[lack of asynchronicity in _Net-⁠SNMP_ AgentX protocol implementation][lack]. I
urge you to read it if you want to integrate a SNMP subagent into an
existing program.

On the _manager side_, you will get similar drawbacks when using
SNMPv3. To retrieve or manipulate management information using SNMPv3,
it is necessary to know the identifier of the remote SNMP protocol
engine. This identifier can be configured directly on each manager but
it is usually discovered by querying
`SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB::‌snmpEngineID`, as described in [RFC 5343][].

Unfortunately, this discovery is done **synchronously** by
_Net-⁠SNMP_. There is a [bug report][3446148] for this issue but it
seems difficult to fix. I have not been able to come up with a proper
patch but I have described a [workaround][] around
`snmp_sess_async_send()`.

There is no such problem with SNMPv2.

## Limitation of file descriptor sets

`snmp_select_info()` and `snmp_read()` uses the `fd_set` type to
handle a set of file descriptors. This type should be manipulated with
`FD_CLR()`, `FD_ISSET()`, `FD_SET()` and `FD_ZERO()`. They may be
defined as functions but they usually are macros. Moreover, no file
descriptor greater than `FD_SETSIZE` (which is usually set to 1024)
can be handled with the `fd_set` type. This means that if you have a
file descriptor greater than 1024, you won't be able to use
`snmp_select_info()` with it.

Starting from _Net-⁠SNMP_ 5.5, you can use `snmp_select_info2()` and
`snmp_read2()` instead of `snmp_select_info()` and `snmp_read()`. They
use the `netsnmp_large_fd_set`.

If you want to keep compatibility with _Net-⁠SNMP_ 5.4, here is another
twist. The `fd_set` type is usually a fixed-size array of long
integers. `FD_CLR()`, `FD_ISSET()` and `FD_SET()` are
size-independant. The size only matters for `FD_ZERO()` which is not
used by either `snmp_select_info()` or `snmp_read()`. You can
therefore allocate a larger `fd_set`. A common way is to compile your
program with `-D__FD_SETSIZE=4096`. You can still use `FD_ZERO()`
yourself. However, this is not portable (GNU C Library only). Another
way is to allocate your own array of long integers and cast it to
`fd_set`. You'll have to redefine `FD_ZERO()`:

    ::c
    typedef struct {
       long int fds_bits[4096/sizeof(long int)];
    } my_fdset;

    #undef FD_ZERO
    #define FD_ZERO(fdset) memset((fdset), 0, sizeof(my_fdset))

    {
       /* ... */
       my_fdset fdset;
       FD_ZERO(&fdset);
       /* ... */
       rc = snmp_select_info(&n, (fd_set *)&fdset, &timeout, &block);
       /* ... */
    }

## Threads

_Net-⁠SNMP_ provides two API:

 - the traditional session API which is not thread-safe and
 - the single session API.

In the above examples, I have used the traditional session API. If you
are using threads, you need to ensure that _all_ SNMP operations are
done in a single thread. Otherwise, you need to adapt the examples to
use the single session API. `snmp_select_info()` is part of the
traditional session API. You should replace it with
`snmp_sess_select_info()` and keep a list of SNMP sessions.

This API is not available for the agent side of _Net-⁠SNMP_.
