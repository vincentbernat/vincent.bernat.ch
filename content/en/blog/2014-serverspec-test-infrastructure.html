Checking if your servers are configured correctly can be done with IT
automation tools like [Puppet][], [Chef][], [Ansible][] or
[Salt][]. They allow an administrator to specify a target
configuration and ensure it is applied. They can also run in a dry-run
mode and report servers not matching the expected configuration.

On the other hand, [serverspec][] is a tool to bring the well known
[RSpec][], a testing tool for the _Ruby_ programming language
frequently used for [test-driven development][], to the infrastructure
world. It can be used to **remotely test server state** through an SSH
connection.

Why one would use such an additional tool? Many things are easier to
express with a test than with a configuration change, like for example
checking that a service is correctly installed by checking it is
listening to some port.

# Getting started

Good knowledge of _Ruby_ may help but is not a prerequisite to the use
of _serverspec_. Writing tests feels like writing what we expect in
plain English. If you think you need to know more about _Ruby_,
here are two short resources to get started:

 - [Ruby in Twenty Minutes][]
 - [Ruby Primer][]

[serverspec's homepage][serverspec] contains a short and concise
tutorial on how to get started. Please, read it. As a first
illustration, here is a test checking a service is correctly listening
on port 80:

    ::ruby
    describe port(80) do
      it { should be_listening }
    end

The following test will spot servers still running with Debian Squeeze
instead of Debian Wheezy:

    ::ruby
    describe command("lsb_release -d") do
      it { should return_stdout /wheezy/ }
    end

Conditional tests are also possible. For example, we want to check the
`miimon` parameter of `bond0`, but only when the interface is present:

    ::ruby
    has_bond0 = file('/sys/class/net/bond0').directory?
    
    # miimon should be set to something other than 0, otherwise, no checks
    # are performed.
    describe file("/sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/miimon"), :if => has_bond0 do
      it { should be_file }
      its(:content) { should_not eq "0\n" }
    end

_serverspec_ comes with a
[complete documentation of available resource types][doc] (like `port`
and `command`) that can be used after the keyword `describe`.

When a test is too complex to be expressed with simple expectations,
it can be specified with arbitrary commands. In the below example, we
check if `memcached` is configured to use almost all the available
system memory:

    ::ruby
    # We want memcached to use almost all memory. With a 2GB margin.
    describe "memcached" do
      it "should use almost all memory" do
        total = command("vmstat -s | head -1").stdout # ➊
        total = /\d+/.match(total)[0].to_i
        total /= 1024
        args = process("memcached").args # ➋
        memcached = /-m (\d+)/.match(args)[1].to_i
        (total - memcached).should be > 0
        (total - memcached).should be < 2000
      end
    end

A bit more arcane, but still understandable: we combine arbitrary
shell commands (in ➊) and use of other _serverspec_ resource types (in
➋).

# Advanced use

Out of the box, _serverspec_ provides a strong fundation to build a
compliance tool to be run on all systems. It comes with some
[useful advanced tips][tips], like sharing tests among
similar hosts or executing several tests in parallel.

I have setup a [_GitHub_ repository][github] to be used as a template
to get the following features:

 - assign roles to servers and tests to roles;
 - parallel execution;
 - report generation & viewer.

## Host classification

By default, `serverspec-init` generates a template where each host has
its own directory with its unique set of tests. _serverspec_ only
handles test execution on remote hosts: the test execution flow (which
tests are executed on which servers) is delegated to some
`Rakefile`[^rakefile]. Instead of extracting the list of hosts to test
from a directory hiearchy, we can extract it from a file (or from an
LDAP server or from any source) and attach a set of roles to each of
them:

    ::ruby
    hosts = File.foreach("hosts")
      .map { |line| line.strip }
      .map do |host|
      {
        :name => host.strip,
        :roles => roles(host.strip),
      }
    end

[^rakefile]: A `Rakefile` is a `Makefile` where tasks and their
             dependencies are described in plain _Ruby_. `rake` will
             execute them in the appropriate order.

The `roles()` function should return a list of roles for a given
hostname. It could be something as simple as this:

    ::ruby
    def roles(host)
      roles = [ "all" ]
      case host
      when /^web-/
        roles << "web"
      when /^memc-/
        roles << "memcache"
      when /^lb-/
        roles << "lb"
      when /^proxy-/
        roles << "proxy"
      end
      roles
    end

In the snippet below, we create a task for each server as well as a
`server:all` task that will execute the tests for all hosts (in ➊). Pay
attention, in ➋, at how we attach the roles to each server.

    ::ruby
    namespace :server do
      desc "Run serverspec to all hosts"
      task :all => hosts.map { |h| h[:name] } # ➊
      
      hosts.each do |host|
        desc "Run serverspec to host #{host[:name]}"
        ServerspecTask.new(host[:name].to_sym) do |t|
          t.target = host[:name]
          # ➋: Build the list of tests to execute from server roles
          t.pattern = './spec/{' + host[:roles].join(",") + '}/*_spec.rb'
        end
      end
    end

You can check the list of tasks created:

    ::console
    $ rake -T
    rake check:server:all      # Run serverspec to all hosts
    rake check:server:web-10   # Run serverspec to host web-10
    rake check:server:web-11   # Run serverspec to host web-11
    rake check:server:web-12   # Run serverspec to host web-12

Then, you need to modify `spec/spec_helper.rb` to tell _serverspec_ to
fetch the host to test from the environment variable `TARGET_HOST`
instead of extracting it from the spec file name.

## Parallel execution

By default, each task is executed when the previous one has
finished. With many hosts, this can take some time. `rake` provides
the `-j` flag to specify the number of tasks to be executed in
parallel and the `-m` flag to apply parallelism to all tasks:

    ::console
    $ rake -j 10 -m check:server:all

## Reports

`rspec` is invoked for each host. Therefore, the output is something
like this:

    ::console
    $ rake spec
    env TARGET_HOST=web-10 /usr/bin/ruby -S rspec spec/web/apache2_spec.rb spec/all/debian_spec.rb
    ......
    
    Finished in 0.99715 seconds
    6 examples, 0 failures
    
    env TARGET_HOST=web-11 /usr/bin/ruby -S rspec spec/web/apache2_spec.rb spec/all/debian_spec.rb
    ......
    
    Finished in 1.45411 seconds
    6 examples, 0 failures

This does not scale well if you have dozens or hundreds of hosts to
test. Moreover, the output is mangled with parallel
execution. Fortunately, `rspec` comes with the ability to save results
in JSON format. Those per-host results can then be consolidated into a
single JSON file. All this can be done in the `Rakefile`:

 1. For each task, set `rspec_opts` to `--format json --out
    ./reports/current/#{target}.json`. This is done automatically by
    the subclass `ServerspecTask` which also handles passing the
    hostname in an environment variable and a more concise and colored
    output.

 2. Add a task to collect the generated JSON files into a single
    report. The test source code is also embedded in the report to
    make it self-sufficient. Moreover, this task is executed
    automatically by adding it as a dependency of the last
    _serverspec_-related task.

Have a look at the [complete `Rakefile`][rakefile] for more details on
how this is done.

A very simple web-based viewer can handle those reports[^viewer]. It
shows the test results as a matrix with failed tests in red:

![Report viewer example][report-viewer-1]
[report-viewer-1]: [[!!images/serverspec-1.png]] "Short report example as displayed by the viewer"

Clicking on any test will display the necessary information to
troubleshoot errors, including the test short description, the
complete test code, the expectation message and the backtrace:

![Report viewer showing detailed error][report-viewer-2]
[report-viewer-2]: [[!!images/serverspec-2.png]] "A failed test displayed in the viewer"

[^viewer]: The viewer is available in the [GitHub repository][github]
           in the `viewer/` directory.

I hope this additional layer will help making _serverspec_ another
feather in the "IT" cap, between an automation tool and a supervision
tool.
