My most loathed feature of [Go][] _was_ the mandatory use of `GOPATH`:
I do not want to put my own code next to its dependencies. I was not
alone and people devised tools or crafted their own `Makefile` to
avoid organizing their code around `GOPATH`.

Hopefully, since Go 1.11, it is possible to use Go's [modules][] to
manage dependencies without relying on `GOPATH`. First, you need to
convert your project to a *module*:[^name]

    ::console
    $ go mod init hellogopher
    go: creating new go.mod: module hellogopher
    $ cat go.mod
    module hellogopher

[^name]: For an application not meant to be used as a library, I
    prefer to use a short name instead of a name derived from an URL,
    like `github.com/vincentbernat/hellogopher`. It makes it easier to
    read import sections:

        ::go
        import (
                "fmt"
                "os"

                "hellogopher/cmd"

                "github.com/pkg/errors"
                "github.com/spf13/cobra"
        )

Then, you can invoke the usual commands, like `go build` or `go test`.
The `go` command resolves imports by using versions listed in
`go.mod`. When it runs into an import of a package not present in
`go.mod`, it automatically looks up the module containing that package
using the latest version and adds it.

    ::console
    $ go test ./...
    go: finding github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.5
    go: downloading github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.5
    ?       hellogopher     [no test files]
    ?       hellogopher/cmd [no test files]
    ok      hellogopher/hello       0.001s
    $ cat go.mod
    module hellogopher

    require github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.5

If you want a specific version, you can either edit `go.mod` or invoke
`go get`:

    ::console
    $ go get github.com/spf13/cobra@v0.0.4
    go: finding github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.4
    go: downloading github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.4
    $ cat go.mod
    module hellogopher

    require github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.4

Add `go.mod` to your version control system. Optionally,[^gosum] you
can also add `go.sum` as a safety net against overridden tags. If you
really want to [vendor][vendoring] the dependencies, you can invoke
`go mod vendor` and add the `vendor/` directory to your version
control system.

[^gosum]: Starting from Go 1.16, without a `go.sum` file, you need
    additional steps to generate it. It seems easier to add it to your
    version control system.

Thanks to the modules, in my opinion, Go's dependency management is
now on a par with other languages, like Ruby. While it is possible to
run day-to-day operations—building and testing—with only the `go`
command, a `Makefile` can still be useful to organize common tasks, a
bit like Python's `setup.py` or Ruby's `Rakefile`. Let me describe
[mine][].

# Using third-party tools

Most projects need some third-party tools for testing or building. We
can either expect them to be already installed or **compile them** on
the fly. For example, here is how code linting is done with
[Golint][]:

    ::make
    BIN = $(CURDIR)/bin
    $(BIN):
    	@mkdir -p $@
    $(BIN)/%: | $(BIN)
    	@tmp=$$(mktemp -d); \
    	   env GO111MODULE=off GOPATH=$$tmp GOBIN=$(BIN) go get $(PACKAGE) \
    		|| ret=$$?; \
    	   rm -rf $$tmp ; exit $$ret

    $(BIN)/golint: PACKAGE=golang.org/x/lint/golint

    GOLINT = $(BIN)/golint
    lint: | $(GOLINT)
    	$(GOLINT) -set_exit_status ./...

The first block defines how a third-party tool is built: `go get` is
invoked with the package name matching the tool we want to install. We
do not want to pollute our dependency management and therefore, we are
working in an empty `GOPATH`. The generated binaries are put in
`bin/`.

The second block extends the pattern rule defined in the first block
by providing the package name for `golint`. Additional tools can be
added by just adding another line like this.

The last block defines the recipe to lint the code. The default
linting tool is the `golint` built using the first block but it can be
overridden with `make GOLINT=/usr/bin/golint`.

# Tests

Here are some rules to help running tests:

    ::make
    TIMEOUT  = 20
    PKGS     = $(or $(PKG),$(shell env GO111MODULE=on $(GO) list ./...))
    TESTPKGS = $(shell env GO111MODULE=on $(GO) list -f \
    			'{% raw %}{{ if or .TestGoFiles .XTestGoFiles }}{{ .ImportPath }}{{ end }}{% endraw %}' \
    			$(PKGS))

    TEST_TARGETS := test-default test-bench test-short test-verbose test-race
    test-bench:   ARGS=-run=__absolutelynothing__ -bench=.
    test-short:   ARGS=-short
    test-verbose: ARGS=-v
    test-race:    ARGS=-race
    $(TEST_TARGETS): test
    check test tests: fmt lint
    	go test -timeout $(TIMEOUT)s $(ARGS) $(TESTPKGS)

A user can invoke tests in different ways:

 - `make test` runs all tests;
 - `make test TIMEOUT=10` runs all tests with a timeout of 10 seconds;
 - `make test PKG=hellogopher/cmd` only runs tests for the `cmd` package;
 - `make test ARGS="-v -short"` runs tests with the specified arguments;
 - `make test-race` runs tests with race detector enabled.

`go test` includes a test coverage tool. Unfortunately, it only
handles **one package at a time** and you have to explicitly **list
the packages to be instrumented**, otherwise the instrumentation is
limited to the currently tested package. If you provide too many
packages, the compilation time will skyrocket. Moreover, if you want
an output compatible with *Jenkins*, you need some additional
tools.

    ::make
    COVERAGE_MODE    = atomic
    COVERAGE_PROFILE = $(COVERAGE_DIR)/profile.out
    COVERAGE_XML     = $(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage.xml
    COVERAGE_HTML    = $(COVERAGE_DIR)/index.html
    test-coverage-tools: | $(GOCOVMERGE) $(GOCOV) $(GOCOVXML) # ❶
    test-coverage: COVERAGE_DIR := $(CURDIR)/test/coverage.$(shell date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
    test-coverage: fmt lint test-coverage-tools
    	@mkdir -p $(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage
    	@for pkg in $(TESTPKGS); do \ # ❷
    		go test \
    			-coverpkg=$$(go list -f '{% raw %}{{ join .Deps "\n" }}{% endraw %}' $$pkg | \
    					grep '^$(MODULE)/' | \
    					tr '\n' ',')$$pkg \
    			-covermode=$(COVERAGE_MODE) \
    			-coverprofile="$(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage/`echo $$pkg | tr "/" "-"`.cover" $$pkg ;\
    	 done
    	@$(GOCOVMERGE) $(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage/*.cover > $(COVERAGE_PROFILE)
    	@go tool cover -html=$(COVERAGE_PROFILE) -o $(COVERAGE_HTML)
    	@$(GOCOV) convert $(COVERAGE_PROFILE) | $(GOCOVXML) > $(COVERAGE_XML)

First, we define some variables to let the user override them. In ❶,
we require the following tools—built like `golint` previously:

 - `gocovmerge` merges profiles from different runs into a single one;
 - `gocov-xml` converts a coverage profile to the [Cobertura][]
   format, for *Jenkins*;
 - `gocov` is needed to convert a coverage profile to a format handled
   by `gocov-xml`.

In ❷, for each package to test, we run `go test` with the
`-coverprofile` argument. We also explicitly provide the list of
packages to instrument to `-coverpkg` by using `go list` to get a list
of dependencies for the tested package and keeping only our owns.

!!! "Update (2019-09)" As mentioned in the [comments](#isso-1092),
since Go 1.10, it is possible to test several packages while still
using `-coverprofile`. Therefore, the `test-coverage` recipe can be
simplified a bit and we can drop `gocovmerge`.

# Build

Another useful recipe is to build the program. While this could be
done with just `go build`, it is not uncommon to have to specify build
tags, additional flags, or to execute supplementary build steps. In
the following example, the version is extracted from *Git* tags. It
will replace the value of the `Version` variable in the
`hellogopher/cmd` package.

    ::make
    VERSION ?= $(shell git describe --tags --always --dirty --match=v* 2> /dev/null || \
    			echo v0)
    all: fmt lint | $(BIN)
    	go build \
    		-tags release \
    		-ldflags '-X hellogopher/cmd.Version=$(VERSION)' \
    		-o $(BIN)/hellogopher main.go

The recipe also runs code formatting and linting.

!!! "Update (2019-09)" There is an interesting thread about this
article on [Reddit][]. It contains a clue on how to lock tools needed
for build as well. Several people also prefer to use [Mage][], a build
tool using Go. Ironically, it requires a non-trivial build step.
