My most loathed feature of [Go][] _was_ the mandatory use of `GOPATH`:
I do not want to put my own code next to its dependencies. I was not
alone and people devised tools or crafted their own `Makefile` to
avoid organizing their code around `GOPATH`.

Hopefully, since Go 1.11, it is possible to use Go's [modules][] to
manage dependencies without relying on `GOPATH`. First, you need to
convert your project to a *module*:[^name]

    ::console
    $ go mod init hellogopher
    go: creating new go.mod: module hellogopher
    $ cat go.mod
    module hellogopher

[^name]: For an application not meant to be used as a library, I
    prefer to use a short name instead of a name derived from an URL,
    like `github.com/vincentbernat/hellogopher`. It makes it easier to
    read import sections:
    
        ::go
        import (
                "fmt"
                "os"
                
                "hellogopher/cmd"
                
                "github.com/pkg/errors"
                "github.com/spf13/cobra"
        )

Then, you can invoke the usual commands, like `go build` or `go test`.
The `go` command resolves imports by using versions listed in
`go.mod`. When it runs into an import of a package not present in
`go.mod`, it automatically looks up the module containing that package
using the latest version and adds it.

    ::console
    $ go test ./...
    go: finding github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.5
    go: downloading github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.5
    ?       hellogopher     [no test files]
    ?       hellogopher/cmd [no test files]
    ok      hellogopher/hello       0.001s
    $ cat go.mod
    module hellogopher
    
    require github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.5

If you want a specific version, you can either edit `go.mod` or invoke
`go get`:

    ::console
    $ go get github.com/spf13/cobra@v0.0.4
    go: finding github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.4
    go: downloading github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.4
    $ cat go.mod
    module hellogopher
    
    require github.com/spf13/cobra v0.0.4

Add `go.mod` to your version control system. Optionally, you can also
add `go.sum` as a safety net against overridden tags. If you really
want to [vendor][vendoring] the dependencies, you can invoke `go mod
vendor` and add the `vendor/` directory to your version control
system.

Thanks to the modules, in my opinion, Go's dependency management is
now on a par with other languages, like Ruby. While it is possible to
run day-to-day operations—building and testing—with only the `go`
command, a `Makefile` can still be useful to organize common tasks, a
bit like Python's `setup.py` or Ruby's `Rakefile`. Let me describe
[mine][].

# Using third-party tools

Most projects need some third-party tools for testing or building. We
can either expect them to be already installed or **compile them** on
the fly. For example, here is how code linting is done with
[Golint][]:

    ::make
    BIN = $(CURDIR)/bin
    $(BIN):
    	@mkdir -p $@
    $(BIN)/%: | $(BIN)
    	@tmp=$$(mktemp -d); \
    	   env GO111MODULE=off GOPATH=$$tmp GOBIN=$(BIN) go get $(PACKAGE) \
    		|| ret=$$?; \
    	   rm -rf $$tmp ; exit $$ret
    
    $(BIN)/golint: PACKAGE=golang.org/x/lint/golint

    GOLINT = $(BIN)/golint
    lint: | $(GOLINT)
    	$(GOLINT) -set_exit_status ./...

The first block defines how a third-party tool is built: `go get` is
invoked with the package name matching the tool we want to install. We
do not want to pollute our dependency management and therefore, we are
working in an empty `GOPATH`. The generated binaries are put in
`bin/`.

The second block extends the pattern rule defined in the first block
by providing the package name for `golint`. Additional tools can be
added by just adding another line like this.

The last block defines the recipe to lint the code. The default
linting tool is the `golint` built using the first block but it can be
overridden with `make GOLINT=/usr/bin/golint`.

# Tests

Here are some rules to help running tests:

    ::make
    TIMEOUT  = 20
    PKGS     = $(or $(PKG),$(shell env GO111MODULE=on $(GO) list ./...))
    TESTPKGS = $(shell env GO111MODULE=on $(GO) list -f \
    			'{% raw %}{{ if or .TestGoFiles .XTestGoFiles }}{{ .ImportPath }}{{ end }}{% endraw %}' \
    			$(PKGS))
    
    TEST_TARGETS := test-default test-bench test-short test-verbose test-race
    test-bench:   ARGS=-run=__absolutelynothing__ -bench=.
    test-short:   ARGS=-short
    test-verbose: ARGS=-v
    test-race:    ARGS=-race
    $(TEST_TARGETS): test
    check test tests: fmt lint
    	go test -timeout $(TIMEOUT)s $(ARGS) $(TESTPKGS)

A user can invoke tests in different ways:

 - `make test` runs all tests;
 - `make test TIMEOUT=10` runs all tests with a timeout of 10 seconds;
 - `make test PKG=hellogopher/cmd` only runs tests for the `cmd` package;
 - `make test ARGS="-v -short"` runs tests with the specified arguments;
 - `make test-race` runs tests with race detector enabled.

`go test` includes a test coverage tool. Unfortunately, it only
handles **one package at a time** and you have to explicitly **list
the packages to be instrumented**, otherwise the instrumentation is
limited to the currently tested package. If you provide too many
packages, the compilation time will skyrocket. Moreover, if you want
an output compatible with *Jenkins*, you need some additional
tools.

    ::make
    COVERAGE_MODE    = atomic
    COVERAGE_PROFILE = $(COVERAGE_DIR)/profile.out
    COVERAGE_XML     = $(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage.xml
    COVERAGE_HTML    = $(COVERAGE_DIR)/index.html
    test-coverage-tools: | $(GOCOVMERGE) $(GOCOV) $(GOCOVXML) # ❶
    test-coverage: COVERAGE_DIR := $(CURDIR)/test/coverage.$(shell date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
    test-coverage: fmt lint test-coverage-tools
    	@mkdir -p $(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage
    	@for pkg in $(TESTPKGS); do \ # ❷
    		go test \
    			-coverpkg=$$(go list -f '{% raw %}{{ join .Deps "\n" }}{% endraw %}' $$pkg | \
    					grep '^$(MODULE)/' | \
    					tr '\n' ',')$$pkg \
    			-covermode=$(COVERAGE_MODE) \
    			-coverprofile="$(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage/`echo $$pkg | tr "/" "-"`.cover" $$pkg ;\
    	 done
    	@$(GOCOVMERGE) $(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage/*.cover > $(COVERAGE_PROFILE)
    	@go tool cover -html=$(COVERAGE_PROFILE) -o $(COVERAGE_HTML)
    	@$(GOCOV) convert $(COVERAGE_PROFILE) | $(GOCOVXML) > $(COVERAGE_XML)

First, we define some variables to let the user override them. In ❶,
we require the following tools—built like `golint` previously:

 - `gocovmerge` merges profiles from different runs into a single one;
 - `gocov-xml` converts a coverage profile to the [Cobertura][]
   format, for *Jenkins*;
 - `gocov` is needed to convert a coverage profile to a format handled
   by `gocov-xml`.

In ❷, for each package to test, we run `go test` with the
`-coverprofile` argument. We also explicitly provide the list of
packages to instrument to `-coverpkg` by using `go list` to get a list
of dependencies for the tested package and keeping only our owns.

!!! "Update (2019-09)" As mentioned in the [comments](#isso-1092),
since Go 1.10, it is possible to test several packages while still
using `-coverprofile`. Therefore, the `test-coverage` recipe can be
simplified a bit and we can drop `gocovmerge`.

# Build

Another useful recipe is to build the program. While this could be
done with just `go build`, it is not uncommon to have to specify build
tags, additional flags, or to execute supplementary build steps. In
the following example, the version is extracted from *Git* tags. It
will replace the value of the `Version` variable in the
`hellogopher/cmd` package.

    ::make
    VERSION ?= $(shell git describe --tags --always --dirty --match=v* 2> /dev/null || \
    			echo v0)
    all: fmt lint | $(BIN)
    	go build \
    		-tags release \
    		-ldflags '-X hellogopher/cmd.Version=$(VERSION)' \
    		-o $(BIN)/hellogopher main.go

The recipe also runs code formatting and linting.

!!! "Update (2019-09)" There is an interesting thread about this
article on [Reddit][]. It contains a clue on how to lock tools needed
for build as well. Several people also prefer to use [Mage][], a build
tool using Go. Ironically, it requires a non-trivial build step.
