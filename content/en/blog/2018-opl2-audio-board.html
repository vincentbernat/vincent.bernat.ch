title: "OPL2 Audio Board: an AdLib sound card for Arduino"
description: |
  The OPL2 Audio Board is a sound card powered by an OPL2 chip (as found on the
  AdLib) for Arduino. It can be operated from Linux with ScummVM and DOSBox.

In a [previous article][], I presented the [OPL2LPT][], a sound card
for the parallel port featuring a [Yamaha YM3812][] chip, also known
as *OPL2*‚Äîthe chip of the [AdLib sound card][]. The [OPL2 Audio Board
for Arduino][] is another indie sound card using this chip. However,
instead of relying on a parallel port, it uses a serial interface,
which can be drived from an Arduino board or a Raspberry Pi. While the
*OPL2LPT* targets retrogamers with real hardware, the *OPL2 Audio
Board* cannot be used in the same way. Nonetheless, it can also be
operated from [ScummVM][] and [DOSBox][]!

# Unboxing

The *OPL2 Audio Board* can be purchased on [Tindie][], either as a kit
or fully assembled. I have paired it with a cheap clone of the
[Arduino Nano][]. A library to drive the board is available on
[GitHub][], along with some examples.

One of them is [`DemoTune.ino`][DemoTune.ino]. It plays a short tune
on three channels. It can be compiled and uploaded to the Arduino with
[PlatformIO][]‚Äîinstallable with `pip install platformio`‚Äîusing the
following command:[^nano]

    ::console
    $ platformio ci \
    >   --board nanoatmega328 \
    >   --lib ../../src \
    >   --project-option="targets=upload" \
    >   --project-option="upload_port=/dev/ttyUSB0" \
    >   DemoTune.ino
    [‚Ä¶]
    PLATFORM: Atmel AVR > Arduino Nano ATmega328
    SYSTEM: ATMEGA328P 16MHz 2KB RAM (30KB Flash)
    Converting DemoTune.ino
    [‚Ä¶]
    Configuring upload protocol...
    AVAILABLE: arduino
    CURRENT: upload_protocol = arduino
    Looking for upload port...
    Use manually specified: /dev/ttyUSB0
    Uploading .pioenvs/nanoatmega328/firmware.hex
    [‚Ä¶]
    avrdude: 6618 bytes of flash written
    [‚Ä¶]
    ===== [SUCCESS] Took 5.94 seconds =====

[^nano]: This command is valid for an Arduino Nano. For another board,
    take a look at the output of `platformio boards arduino`.

Immediately after the upload, the Arduino plays the tune. üé∂

The next interesting example is [`SerialIface.ino`][SerialIface.ino].
It turns the audio board into a sound card over serial port. Once the
code has been pushed to the Arduino, you can use the `play.py` program
in the same directory to play VGM files. They are a sample-accurate
sound format for many sound chips. They log the exact commands
sent. There are many of them on [VGMRips][]. Be sure to choose the
ones for the [YM3812/OPL2][]!  Here is a small selection:

# Usage with DOSBox & ScummVM

!!! "Notice" The support for the serial protocol used in this section
has [not been merged][pr20]: instead, a simpler protocol was designed.
You need to grab `SerialIface.ino` from my pull request: `git checkout
50e1717`.


When the Arduino is flashed with `SerialIface.ino`, the board can be
driven through a simple protocol over the serial port. By patching
*DOSBox* and *ScummVM*, we can make them use this unusual sound
card. Here are some examples of games:

![]([[!!videos/2018-opl2-audio-board-2.m3u8]])

 - [0:00](#video-seek-0), with **DOSBox**, the first level of **Doom** üéÆ (1993)
 - [1:06](#video-seek-66), with **DOSBox**, the introduction of **Loom** üéº (1990)
 - [2:38](#video-seek-158), with **DOSBox**, the first level of **Lemmings** üêπ (1991)
 - [3:32](#video-seek-212), with **DOSBox**, the introduction of **Legend of Kyrandia** üÉè (1992)
 - [6:47](#video-seek-407), with **ScummVM**, the introduction of **Day of the Tentacle** ‚ò¢Ô∏è (1993)
 - [11:10](#video-seek-670), with **DOSBox**, the introduction of **Another World** üêÖ (1991)

[Another World][] (also known as *Out of This World*), designed by
√âric Chahi, is using sampled sounds at 5¬†kHz or 10¬†kHz. With a serial
port operating at 115,200¬†bits/s, the 5¬†kHz option is just within our
reach. <del>However, I have no idea if the rendering is
faithful.</del>

!!! "Update (2018-05)" After some discussions with [Walter van
Niftrik][], we came to the conclusion that, above 1¬†kHz, *DOSBox*
doesn't "time-accurately" execute OPL commands. It is using a time
slice of one millisecond during which it executes either a fixed
number of CPU cycles or as many as possible (with `cycles=max`). In
both cases, emulated CPU instructions are executed as fast as possible
and I/O delays are simulated by removing a fixed number of cycles from
the allocation of the current time slice.

## DOSBox

The serial protocol is described in the `SerialIface.ino` file:

    ::c
    /*
     * A very simple serial protocol is used.
     *
     * - Initial 3-way handshake to overcome reset delay / serial noise issues.
     * - 5-byte binary commands to write registers.
     *   - (uint8)  OPL2 register address
     *   - (uint8)  OPL2 register data
     *   - (int16)  delay (milliseconds); negative -> pre-delay; positive -> post-delay
     *   - (uint8)  delay (microseconds / 4)
     *
     * Example session:
     *
     * Arduino: HLO!
     * PC:      BUF?
     * Arduino: 256 (switches to binary mode)
     * PC:      0xb80a014f02 (write OPL register and delay)
     * Arduino: k
     *
     * A variant of this protocol is available without the delays. In this
     * case, the BUF? command should be sent as B0F? The binary protocol
     * is now using 2-byte binary commands:
     *   - (uint8)  OPL2 register address
     *   - (uint8)  OPL2 register data
     */

Adding support for this protocol in *DOSBox* is relatively simple
([patch][dosbox-patch]). For best performance, we use the 2-byte
variant (5000 ops/s). The binary commands are pipelined and a
dedicated thread collects the acknowledgments. A [semaphore][]
captures the number of free slots in the receive buffer. As it is not
possible to read registers, we rely on *DOSBox* to emulate the timers,
which are mostly used to let the various games [detect the OPL2][].

The patch is tested only on Linux but should work on any POSIX
system‚Äînot Windows.  To test it, you need to build *DOSBox* from
source:

    ::console
    $ sudo apt build-dep dosbox
    $ git clone https://github.com/vincentbernat/dosbox.git -b feature/opl2audioboard
    $ cd dosbox
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure && make

Replace the `sblaster` section of `~/.dosbox/dosbox-SVN.conf`:

    ::ini
    [sblaster]
    sbtype=none
    oplmode=opl2
    oplrate=49716
    oplemu=opl2arduino
    opl2arduino=/dev/ttyUSB0

Then, run *DOSBox* with `./src/dosbox`. That's it!

You will likely get the "`OPL2Arduino: too slow, consider increasing
buffer`" message a lot. To fix this, you need to recompile
`SerialIface.ino` with a bigger receive buffer:

    ::console
    $ platformio ci \
    >   --board nanoatmega328 \
    >   --lib ../../src \
    >   --project-option="targets=upload" \
    >   --project-option="upload_port=/dev/ttyUSB0" \
    >   --project-option="build_flags=-DSERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE=512" \
    >   SerialIface.ino

## ScummVM

The same code can be adapted for *ScummVM*
([patch][patch-scummvm]). To test, build it from source:

    ::console
    $ sudo apt build-dep scummvm
    $ git clone https://github.com/vincentbernat/scummvm.git -b feature/opl2audioboard
    $ cd scummvm
    $ ./configure --disable-all-engines --enable-engine=scumm && make

Then, you can start *ScummVM* with `./scummvm`. Select "AdLib
Emulator" as the music device and "OPL2 Arduino" as the AdLib
emulator.[^serial] Like for *DOSBox*, watch the console to check if
you need a larger receive buffer.

[^serial]: If you need to specify a serial port other than
    `/dev/ttyUSB0`, add a line `opl2arduino_device=` in the
    `~/.scummvmrc` configuration file.

Enjoy! üé∂
