Earlier this year, [we][] released [Akvorado][], a flow collector, enricher, and
visualizer. It receives network flows from your routers using either [NetFlow
v9][], [IPFIX][], or [sFlow][]. Several pieces of information are added, like
GeoIP and interface names. The flows are exported to [Apache Kafka][kafka], a
distributed queue, then stored inside [ClickHouse][], a column-oriented
database. A web frontend is provided to run queries. A [live version][demo] is
available for you to play.

Several alternatives exist:

- [Kentik][], a popular cloud-based solution,
- [ElastiFlow][], a self-hosted proprietary solution, or
- your own assembly of open source solutions by picking a flow collector
  ([pmacct][], [GoFlow2][], or [vFlow][]), a distributed queue[^queue] ([Apache
  Kafka][kafka] or [RabbitMQ][]), a database ([ClickHouse][], [Elasticsearch][],
  or [Apache Pinot][]), and a web frontend ([Grafana][], [Kibana][], or [Apache
  Superset][]).

[^queue]: While the collector could write directly to the database, the queue
    buffers flows if the database is unavailable. It also enables you to process
    flows with another piece of software (like an anti-DDoS system).

*Akvorado* differentiates itself from these solutions because:

- it is open source (licensed under the [AGPLv3 license][agpl]), and
- it bundles flow collection, storage, and a web interface into a single
  "product."

The proposed deployment solution relies on [Docker Compose][] to set up
*Akvorado*, *Zookeeper*, *Kafka*, and *ClickHouse*. I hope it should be enough
for anyone to [get started quickly][]. *Akvorado* is performant enough to handle
100Â 000 flows per second with 64 GB of RAM and 24 vCPU. With 2Â TB of disk, you
should expect to keep data for a few years.

I spent some time writing a [fairly complete documentation][documentation]. It
seems redundant to repeat its content in this blog post. There is also a section
about its [internal design][] if you are interested in how it is built. I also
did a [FRnOG presentation][] earlier this year, and a [ClickHouse meetup
presentation][], which focuses more on how *ClickHouse* is used. I plan to write
more detailed articles on specific aspects of *Akvorado*. Stay tuned! ðŸ“»
